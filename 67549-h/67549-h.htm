  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>HOME-COMING OF THE BRIDE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“This road isn’t called Perfection Road, is it?”
she asked jerkily, as she held tight hold of the edge
of the waggon to prevent herself from being pitched
head foremost off the seat. She would have laid her
head against her companion’s shoulder only that it
was square and hard, and she was afraid of getting
her temple “stove in,” as the sailors say, by the terrific
bumps caused by the wheels going over a big
stone or down into a deep rut. She was a bride, and
he was bringing her to their new home on the Kansas
Prairie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My poor little pet,” he said tenderly, “it is very
rough here. We are going down into Cotton Wood
Creek, and these stones were cast up by the last freshet
which pretty well washed the road away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They plunged headlong into the muddy waters
of the Creek, and the little bride would have felt
frightened only that “he” was by her side, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>waggon creaked and groaned with the strain, and the
horses snorted uneasily, feeling their way carefully
through the rushing torrent. The Creek was safely
passed, and they slowly toiled up the long hill out of
the bottom-lands, and pulled up when once more on
the high prairie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is our home, dearie,” he said, pointing
with his whip to some scattered houses a couple of
miles away. And being a bridegroom he kissed her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So that is Perfection City, is it?” said she, shading
her eyes with her hand, for the afternoon sun sent
level rays into her face. “You know, Ezra, it is such
a funny name, I always feel inclined to laugh when
I say it. And how I shall ever dare to put it at the
top of my letters as a real address when I write to
the girls at the College at Smyrna, is more than I
know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then don’t write it,” replied Ezra, a trifle sternly.
“It will hurt our feelings very much if you laugh
at it. You know it means a great deal to all of us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I’ll never laugh at it,” said the little
bride.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which is our house?” she asked a moment later.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The one half way up the slope.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that is nice. I like looking down across
things. I shouldn’t like to live in a valley and always
have to look up, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The large building is the Academy,” said Ezra.
“That is where we hold our meetings and gather together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>for all the best purposes of our little community-life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it there that Madame Morozoff-Smith lives?”
asked his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Her house is the one just opposite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that big one! It is quite the largest in the
village—the City, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra did not make any reply to this remark. He
had never realised that Madame’s house was indeed
the largest in their Community, and now he felt vexed
that this fact should have been the first his wife noted.</p>

<p class='c010'>A small boy with shining black face and shining
white teeth, along with a yellow puppy, welcomed
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is Napoleon Pompey,” said Ezra, with much
decorum presenting the small darkie who grinned and
bobbed his head. “And this is Diana,” pointing to
the puppy that had come up to the bars along with
the negro. Diana jumped upon her new mistress and
left two black dust marks on her dress. Dust is
black in London and on the western prairie, nowhere
else.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you dirty dog,” said the little bride, who was
a very natty body.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll have to get used to dirt in all degrees
out here, Ollie,” said her husband as he led her to
the door. She looked like a little girl as she stood
beside him, for he was tall and angular and long of
leg. A sloping plank with battens nailed across it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>led to the door, there were no steps. As the pair entered,
Napoleon Pompey and Diana took the horses
and waggon to the stable and began respectively to unharness
and worry them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a dear little house! It is just like a toy!
And do look at the saws hanging on the walls beside
the covers of the pots! Oh, won’t it be so nice and
free living here! I shall feel like an explorer in a
far country. And how funny to have nail-kegs for
seats, and oh, you dear old darling!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive jumped up and kissed her big husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Things are rough now, dearie,” he said with
infinite tenderness, looking at her with loving admiration,
“but by and by we shall have everything very
nice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I think it is just as nice as it can be
now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is our room,” said he, opening a door to
the right.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, if you haven’t gone and got a rocking-chair!”
exclaimed Olive, glancing around the small
apartment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I made it for you myself in spare time,” answered
Ezra, pleased that she had noticed the chair the first
thing: he had often wondered, when working at that
rocking-chair, whether she would be pleased with it.
“You see,” he continued, “we have to work only
five days a week for the Community. All the rest
of our time is at our own disposal, and by and by,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>when we are flourishing, four days for the Community
will suffice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you like working for other people and not
being paid?” asked Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not consider it as working for other people
without pay,” replied her husband, with some quickness.
“We each work for the general good, and if I
happen to plant corn that someone else will eat, then
some other member of the Community raises potatoes
that I shall eat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There, there, don’t be cross,” said the little wife,
noting the flush that had risen to his brow as he spoke.
“I am sure it is nice, and I shall like it when I
understand it all. At any rate we shall be very
happy whatever happens, and I like my dear little
house, and please, I am very thirsty, can I have a
drink?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He brought her some water in a tin dipper with
a long handle, and she did not make a face, but drank
the water gratefully. She determined in her own mind,
however, to have a glass tumbler the very next day, but
she was new to the prairie, and she did not get the
tumbler the next day, nor the next week, nor for
many, many long months.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What time are we to have breakfast?” she asked,
when taking over the household from Napoleon Pompey
and Diana, who had run the establishment while
her husband had been to fetch her from Ohio.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yo’ kin eat when yo’ like,” said Napoleon Pompey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>desiring to be all that was polite to his new mistress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I want to know what time you have breakfast?”
repeated Olive with persistence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We uns got ter be hout on der lan’ ploughin’
afore sun-up,” said Napoleon Pompey concisely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me! Why, that is before six o’clock!” exclaimed
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I calkerlate,” said Napoleon Pompey affably.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra did not want Olive to think she was bound
to get up and prepare the working-man’s breakfast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not used to that sort of hard work,
dearie. We can do very well with cold corn-bread.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of all things the most stoggy and hopelessly uninviting,”
interrupted his wife. “No, Ezra, I won’t
have any of the people out here think I am a little
fool that can’t do any useful work. I have my pride
as well as other folks. I shall cook your breakfast
to-morrow and every day afterwards, and I shall cook
it well, see if I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure of that,” said her husband with the
confidence of a bridegroom.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house of which the young bride had just taken
possession was by no means an ordinary prairie house.
Far from it. It had pretensions to comfort which the
true prairie house should never possess, and it lacked
the few elements of picturesqueness with which the
genuine article is sometimes endowed. The plan on
which it was built was of the simplest—the same that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>children adopt in building their doll’s houses—four
sides and a sloping roof, all of wood from top to bottom.
It was not a log-house, which has a few broken
lines to rest the eye of the beholder and present possibilities
to the artist, it was a frame house, that is,
the straightest, stiffest, squarest, most hopelessly unpicturesque
object that it is possible to imagine, and to
make matters worse it was painted a glaring white
from eave to foundation. There was not a broken line
or a broken tint anywhere to refresh the eye, and
it stood on the high prairie, as if hurled into a glaring
world by a Titan’s hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>The prairie is fertile, and in the eye of a farmer
may possess the beauty of usefulness, but otherwise it
is hideous. The long rolling billows of grass present
no character, while the trees are confined to the river
valleys where they find refuge from prairie fires, and
can therefore lead a sufficiently undisturbed existence
to reach quite a respectable height. A couple of
small locust trees, not three feet high, were all that
did duty as shade-giving plants near Olive’s house,
which accordingly faced the world and its storms entirely
on its own individual merits. Judged by prairie
standard the house was “tip-top.” It possessed no
less than four rooms, while the regular settler’s cabin
was wont to indulge in only a single comprehensive
apartment, which was kitchen, parlour and bedroom
all in one. The two lower rooms were the kitchen,
which was fairly large, and a smaller one off it, reserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>for the private use of the young wife. The
kitchen looked like a ship’s cabin, only that it had
more light than usually penetrates into a ship’s cabin.
In fact it was very light, for there were two large windows,
one to the north and one to the south, geometrically
opposite each other. These two windows,
so exactly facing each other, were fairly typical of the
house itself, which was the embodiment of mathematical
accuracy. The building was placed exactly east
and west, as if it had been a carefully oriented church.
There was a door on the south side, exactly in the
middle, and a window on either side of the door, placed
accurately in the centre of the space left between the
side of the door and the end of the house. Over these
two windows were two others exactly one half their
size, giving light to the loft, and exactly in the centre
of the roof-ridge was a black stove-pipe.</p>

<p class='c010'>The average prairie man is a genius in the way
of doing without things. He can live in a house of
the smallest dimensions, containing the minimum of
utensils. In fact, his idea of a house is that it should
be a miner’s tent solidified into substantiality. The
miner in a newly-prospected gold-field is a person who
spends his days in a hole, and has no belongings but
the clothes on his back and the shovel in his hand.
He lives on his expectations. The regular prairie settler,
would arrive in the spring, camp in his waggon,
stick grains of corn under the sod, and think himself
lucky if he could raise both the corn and a loghut,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>fourteen by twelve feet, before the cold weather
set in. Those who have passed through such a severe
school prune down their requirements. Therefore the
house to which Ezra Weston brought his little bride
was rightly considered to be a model of luxury, or in
prairie phraseology to be “powerful full o’ truck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The kitchen certainly was full. The stove, black
and business-like, stood near the partition wall, and
on it rested a couple of huge iron pots with covers.
Chairs there were none, as Olive had remarked, but
boxes and nail-kegs did as well and were useful in
holding things. There was a large wooden table,
very strongly made, on one side, and a set of shelves
in one corner. The walls and ceiling, which were of
wood closely jointed, added to the ship-like appearance
of the room, but the presence of two large saws
and a horse-collar which hung above them made a considerable
deduction from the nautical character of the
apartment.</p>

<p class='c010'>This model dwelling stood in the midst of a large
tract of fenced-in land. Part of this was already
under cultivation and showed a dark purple surface
to the heavens, betokening newly turned up prairie
sod full of the natural plant foods stored there for
thousands of ages. These were now about to be recklessly
used up by the ordinary system of prairie farming,
which consisted of taking everything out of the
land and of putting nothing back into it. A sort of
road, that is to say a beaten track with deep channels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>on either side, led from the house to the bars, which
did duty as gate to the premises. These bars were precisely
what the name implies, bars of wood lying on
supports made for them between posts, and they were
simply let down whenever horses or other animals
had to pass in or out, and were climbed over by active
children too lazy to let them down or rather, perhaps,
too lazy to put them up again.</p>

<p class='c010'>On one side of the bars stretching out at an angle
was an orchard just planted with trees that probably
would be worth having twenty years hence, and further
away was another field consisting simply of fenced-in
prairie grass. The fields, and indeed everything else,
were square, and every fence that did not run north
and south, ran east and west. The whole place seemed
under a despotism of compass and measuring chain.
Indeed, the prairie itself was under the same iron rule:
and by the authorities had been plotted out into squares
of a mile each way called “sections,” of which persons
could buy of the Government quarter sections or
multiples of a quarter section at a low rate. Fortunately
for humanity this conspiracy to turn the world
into a surveyor’s map was to some extent defeated by
the rivers and streams, which ran as Heaven and the
water-sheds decreed, and not as the officials at Washington
desired. This fact, and this alone, has in some
measure saved the prairie from the awful fate of mathematical
damnation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>UNCLE DAVID.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Weston was tired and sat down in her rocking-chair
to rest. Her day’s work was fairly over.
The breakfast had been ready punctually at half past
five, and it was well-cooked, as she had boasted it
would be—corn-bread smoking hot, fried chicken, potatoes,
flap-jacks and molasses—a meal for a king,
to say nothing of a working-man and his negro help.
Ezra and Napoleon Pompey had partaken heartily,
especially the latter, for he had been living on underdone
hoe-cake and cold pork. Then they had gone
off to the ploughing, while Olive had bustled around
and got forward with her house-work. At eleven
o’clock she had run up the towel against the shady
side of the house, a signal easily seen from the distant
field, and signifying that dinner was ready. They
had come home, men and horses thoroughly hungry
and ready for food and rest. Ezra lay on the kitchen
floor and talked to her while she washed up the dishes.
And now it was three o’clock, and all the work was
done. She thought she would read a little. She had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>several books with her that she had been looking forward
to reading. So she took up one of them and
seated herself comfortably in the rocking-chair. The
door was open and a warm air came in from the south
along with the gleaming sunshine. Diana lay across
the door-way, but kept one eye open, so as to see
when the black hen came near enough to have a spring
at her with any chance of grabbing a mouthful of tail-feathers.
Olive’s eyes rested very little on the book,
but much on the view outside. It looked pleasant
enough in the bright May sunshine. The long brown
patch of the garden showed a few methodical green
lines that spoke of vegetables beginning to sprout.
The meadow of blue grass just beyond was likewise
by its hue showing the on-coming of the warm spring
weather, and yet again further off, on the other side
of the meadow, lay the vast field which her husband
was ploughing. Once in every half hour she could
see him turn at the head-land, and noted how seldom
he seemed to stop and rest. Napoleon Pompey was
riding the off leader, and from that distance they
seemed little insects gently crawling backwards and
forwards across the land. Pleasant it looked too and
by no means hard work. Olive determined to go out
to the field one day soon and watch the process from a
nearer point of view; she might indeed herself hold
the plough-handles, it looked easy, she would ask Ezra
to let her, she would like to learn to do all sorts of
work so as to be very useful, she would—confused images
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>swept slowly over her mind, she leaned back her
pretty little head and slept in her chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>She awoke with a start. A large square figure
stood in the door-way, blocking out the sunshine, and
Diana, with the insane friendliness of a puppy, was
trying to clamber up one of his legs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, little gal, I reckon you’re ’most tired out,
ain’t you?” said the big man, coming straight into
the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Weston rose to her utmost height of five feet
two inches, and tried to be dignified.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you wish to see my husband?” she inquired
stiffly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t want to see Ezry. I come to talk to
you a spell, and see you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very kind I’m sure,” returned the little
lady icily, but the stranger did not seem one whit
abashed. He took a nail-keg and sat down on it and
looked about him. “Wal, now,” he remarked, nodding
his head, “Ezry is real downright handy. He’s
gone and got your house fine and fixed up, ain’t he
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is extremely comfortable, Mr.—ah—I don’t
think you mentioned your name,” said Mrs. Weston,
with a snap of her black eyes. She didn’t at all relish
the free and easy way in which this man spoke of her
husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do tell!” exclaimed the stranger with vast cordiality.
“An’ you didn’t know who I was. Why, I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Uncle David. I guessed everybody ’ud know me.
There ain’t nobody else so big and awkward looking
’bout here on this prairie as me. Why, there was
a man over to Perfection City yesterday, he come from
beyond Cotton Wood Creek, and he said he calculated
I’d be powerful useful on washing days, ’cause if they
tied the clothes-line to me I’d do instead of a pole,
an’ timber is mighty scarce anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Uncle David gave a long loud laugh that set Diana
into an ecstasy of delight, and was of itself so joyous
that, after a moment, Olive also joined in with a merry
titter. She had often heard her husband speak of
Uncle David, as being one of the kindest and most
simple-hearted of men. Her frigid manner melted rapidly
and completely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, now,” began Uncle David again, after his
merriment had subsided, “how do you like our
name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your name,” repeated Olive considerably puzzled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, our name, the name of the Community, Perfection
City. Do you like it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think I do,” replied she.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jes’ so,” broke in Uncle David, apparently much
pleased with this answer. “I knew you wouldn’t. Nobody
does.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you call it such a name—such a horrid
name—and if nobody likes it, what is the use?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There now, that’s what they all say, until I talk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>to ’em,” said Uncle David. “You see I gave the name
to the place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it was your choice!” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When we came here, Niece and I, there wasn’t
no town nor nothing, it was just open prairie. Ezry
he come along too with us, and the Carpenters, and
Mrs. Ruby, and the Wrights.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You leave out Madame Morozoff-Smith,” interrupted
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you knew. Why, Madame, she’s Niece.
She ain’t my real niece, she wasn’t born in my family,
but she’s niece by adoption, and I hold she’s more to
me than half the nieces I ever seen. I ain’t cute like
most of the folks here, an’ there wasn’t no use in having
me at Perfection City. I can’t do nothing. I
can’t compose papers like Brother Wright. So I was
studyin’ to see some way for me to come with ’em.
It would ha’ broke my heart to be left behind. Madame,
she come to me, an’ says she: ‘You’ll be my
uncle. I want an uncle very much, and I’ll love you
dearly.’ An’ so I was. I call it the greatest honour
of my life when Madame made me her uncle, and added
my name to hers.” Uncle David stooped and patted
Diana’s head thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When did you think of the name?” said Olive
with a view to bringing him back to the point.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, jes’ so, that’s ’xactly what I was comin’ to.
You see, when Ezry fust come here with us he wasn’t
quite clear in his mind ’bout joinin’ in with us, leastways
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>not to be one of the Community for his whole
mortal life. It’s a serious step to take, and he was
a-doubtin’ in his mind, leastways till Madame she
talked to him for a spell. He wasn’t sure fust if he’d
got a call to community-life. He knowed it was the
best, of course, and the true life: he knowed all that
right enough, but he didn’t feel sure of himself as bein’
fit to found a city. It is a most responsible thing to
be a founder. ’Taint everybody as is fit for it. Then
Madame made it clear how she was a founder, an’ she
is the most wonderful woman ever lived in this world,
an’ she showed Ezry how it was his duty to help in
this great work, an’ when he saw that clear he was
dreadful sot on it too. We was a-gettin’ our houses
up as spry as ever we could, and ole Wright he was
a-buildin’ th’ Academy, then Ezry says: ‘What’s goin’
to be our name?’ It was jes’ called Weddell’s Gully,
’cause we bought from a man o’ that name. So Ezry
said: ‘Let’s call it something to signify our principles,’
and one person said one name and one said another,
then Wright said ‘Let’s call it Teleiopolis.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that sounds very pretty,” exclaimed Olive.
“Why didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, now, I said that’s very pretty, jes’ the same
as you did. What does it mean, do you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t know. I suppose it is Greek for
something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Zactly so. It is Greek for something, and that
something is Perfection City.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“It sounds nicer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe so, but you look here. Are we Greeks?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, of course not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then why talk in Greek?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know, except it is prettier.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you suppose them old Greeks, when they went
an’ founded cities, they called ’em names out o’ some
other language they didn’t understand, or did they
called ’em good solid Greek names as any little boy
’ud know what they meant?” asked Uncle David with
rising energy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe they called their cities by Greek names,
in fact I know they did,” said Olive, hastily reviewing
her stock of history.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ why?” asked Uncle David.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because they wasn’t ’shamed o’ their mother
tongue like we are. That’s why,” said Uncle David,
clapping his big hand on his knee.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh indeed,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ that’s what I said, says I, ‘We are ’Mericans,
we are founding a new city that’s goin’ to be great
things one day. We have our principles. Let’s live
up to them. We hain’t shamed o’ nothin’. Leastways
not to my knowledge. We are goin’ to be an example
to these folks roun’ here. We are goin’ to show
’em how to live a better life nor they ever did before.
An’ how in thunder can we do that if we start by
being ’shamed of our own mother tongue? We hain’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Greeks, we don’t talk in Greek. This hain’t Teleiopolis,
this is Perfection City.’ That is what I said to
’em.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did they say to that?” asked Olive,
much interested in the rugged honesty of Uncle
David.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, I don’t know as they said anything much,
on’y Ezry, he said he guessed he’d had his fust lesson,
an’ he come and shook hands an’ said it certainly
should be Perfection City, an’ so it was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall think better of the name now,” said Olive.
“Only at first I was afraid of people laughing, people
who didn’t understand it, you see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, people’ll laugh,” said Uncle David. “People
does a heap o’ laughing in this world without makin’
it one mite merrier for anybody. I like laughing
myself. It’s awful good an’ satisfyin’ to have a real
square laugh, but t’aint that sort. Mos’ folks’ laugh
hain’t got no more fun in it than the laugh of a hoot-owl.
I’d a heap sight rather have none at all. You
ain’t agoin’ to mind that sort, I hope?” Uncle David
spoke with a shade of anxiety in his manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh no, I’m not thin-skinned,” said Olive with
a superior smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some folks is made that way. When they have
found a tender spot in anybody they can’t rest no
how till they’ve stuck some sort o’ pin into it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me, does everything belong to everybody
generally out here? It is so puzzling. This house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>for instance, is it ours or yours or everybody’s?”
asked Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The land an’ the horses an’ the cattle an’ waggons
was mostly bought with community-money, that is
Madame, she gave the money, she’s rich you know,
an’ she’s generous and always givin’ to the Community,
her whole heart is in it. But Ezry worked a heap on
this house, he mostly built it all, an’ it’s his, an’ t’other
folks’ houses are theirs. That’s Brother Wright’s over
yonder, an’ that’s our house beside the ’Cademy, most
everybody worked to get it up and fix it comfortable for
Madame. Old Mrs. Ruby, she lives to herself in the
log cabin we bought from Weddell, we had it moved
there a purpose over from the Gully, ’cause she liked
to live beside the spring so as to get her water handy.
She had a little mite of money which we used in buyin’
stock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you do have some things as private property,
just like ordinary people,” observed Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course. It would not be any sort o’ use to
have everything in common, ’cause folks’ notions
don’t always ’xactly suit. An’ what we want is to
have everybody free, so they can be perfectly happy
here. We don’t want to have no strife, an’ no jealousy,
an’ no ill feeling one towards another. But there
can’t be community in all things. What sort o’
use would it be for you an’ me to have community
o’ boots an’ shoes?” said Uncle David with a great
laugh, sticking out his enormous foot towards where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Olive’s dainty little slipper peeped from beneath her
dress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your shoes, my dear, wouldn’t go on my two
fingers, an’ mine ’ud be big enough to make a tol’eble
boat for you. There couldn’t be community in shoes,
so there ain’t none. But with the lan’ it’s different.
We all work that for the benefit of everybody, there
ain’t no strugglin’ to be fust an’ get ahead o’ one another.
We are all brothers at Perfection City.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was full of excitement when Ezra came back
at sun-down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just fancy, I’ve had my first visitor,” she said
as she stood beside her husband while he was watering
the horses.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who was it? Mrs. Ruby?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it was Uncle David,” and she gave a merry
little laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, and how did you like him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think he is just charming. He is just like a
piece of granite or oak or something of that sort, not
smooth or shiny on the outside, but solid and sound
to the very core. Oh! I shall love Uncle David.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right. He is a good man,” said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you know? he has made me understand
about Perfection City. I shan’t want to laugh at it
any more, and I don’t care if anybody else does. It
was real brave of you showing your colours plain and
sticking to them,” said Olive with a skip and a clap
of her little hands.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>SISTER MARY WINKLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The very next morning just as she was washing
her potatoes for dinner, another visitor called upon
Olive, a visitor of whose sex she was for a moment
or two in doubt. The visitor wore a large sunbonnet,
a check blouse, and a pair of Zouave trowsers fastened
in at the ankle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you do, Olive Weston?” said this person,
in a deep serious voice. Olive, who had not seen
her, started in surprise and dropped her potato into
the basin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am Mary Winkle. That’s my house over yonder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, the Wrights’! Yes, to be sure. Come in and
sit down,” said Olive hospitably, although she felt
considerable surprise at her visitor’s appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t wear the reformed dress yet, I see,”
said Mary Winkle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t,” acquiesced Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. I have not thought about it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>I suppose there is no regulation about what one wears
on the prairie. There is no fashion here I suppose,”
said Olive politely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, only the fashion of common sense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do all the ladies dress that way, Miss Winkle?”
inquired Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only my daughter and myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I beg your pardon, I should have said Mrs. Winkle,”
said Olive, in some confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, you shouldn’t,” replied her visitor. “I am
not Mrs. Winkle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid I am very stupid. Would you tell me
then how I should address you. I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Address me as Mary Winkle, and my husband
as John Wright.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive stared at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you not Mrs. Wright then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, certainly not. I scorn the title. It is a
symbol of subjection. I did not lose my identity when
I chose to marry. I am the same Mary Winkle that
I was before, and as such I desire to retain the name
that I always possessed. Why should I take a new
name simply because I am married?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is usual,” stammered Olive. “I shouldn’t like
not to be called Mrs. Weston. It is so confusing, you
see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mere custom and prejudice. Why should not
your husband take your name, instead of its always
being the wife who is absorbed?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“I don’t know, but I never heard of it before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, that is one of the first changes that must
be made when women get their rights,” observed Mary
Winkle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I don’t want the change one bit. I much
prefer the old way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I dare say. Slaves often feel no want of freedom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not a slave,” said Olive, flushing angrily.
“You cannot be in the least acquainted with my husband.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I know your husband very well, an excellent
man in many respects, but narrow in others;
however, I referred to general slavery, to custom, not
to any individual slavery in your case.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think there is any good in destroying
customs, unless there is something better to be got
in a new custom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah yes, no doubt it seems so to you; but there
is inestimable gain in the mere protest against tyranny.
Why, that’s what we are all here for, to protest
against everything and live a life of freedom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And freedom may as well begin here and now,
and in its name I will wear long dresses and be called
Mrs. Weston, because I prefer the older customs,”
said Olive with some archness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, you may do as you like, but you will get
heartily sick of those skirts, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive remembering sundry pretty dresses she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>in her trunk, was privately convinced she would not
get sick of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t seen Madame yet,” she said, “and I
feel the greatest curiosity about her. She must be
a remarkable woman by all accounts. Does she wear
the same sort of dress as you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, she doesn’t, and it’s a great pity, for her
influence would be very great with the other women.
I suppose you’ll see her to-morrow evening. You’ll
come to the Academy, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, certainly, if Ezra is going. I should like to
go ever so much and see all my neighbours, but perhaps
he will be too tired. He does work dreadfully
hard, it seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He ought to do a little brain-work. Wright
says nothing rests one like brain-work. He’s been
doing a spell of that lately. He’s been writing an
essay on ‘The Ultimate Perfection of Being.’ He’ll
most likely read some of it to-morrow at the Academy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shouldn’t think essays would be much use in
planting corn,” said Olive rather tartly, remembering
at what hour her husband had come from the harrowing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wright and I, we don’t believe in making a god
of work. We have a much higher ideal of life than
that. We don’t want anything sordid in our lives,
Wright and I. We haven’t any sympathy with this
restless striving to get on. One of the great advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of Perfection City is that we all have time for
the cultivation of our higher natures.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just now,” said Olive, “my husband seems to
have no thought in his mind but the cultivation of
that field over there. He is at work early and late.
No person could possibly work harder for himself
or his individual advantage than he does for the Community.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s just a case in point,” remarked Mary
Winkle complacently. “I always thought your husband
very narrow in his views. He slaves away at
this corn planting as if that were the chief end and
object of his existence. It is all very well to work
at times, but working in order to store up food for
the body is the lowest possible form that human activity
can take.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the most indispensable form,” remarked
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By no means,” replied Mary Winkle with precision.
“That observation would seem to indicate that
you are more narrow even than your husband. The
body is merely the servant of the mind: the mind
needs to be fed, and it is the food for the mind which
your husband appears so careless about providing.
Fortunately for Perfection City, Wright has taken
thought on that subject. Wright has a very high
standard of what is necessary for the mind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It appears to me,” said Olive with a snap of her
black eyes and an ominous red spot on her cheeks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“that if we all lived up to your standard, it might
very well happen that by next winter our minds might
be uncomfortably full and our stomachs correspondingly
empty. If Ezra did not plough and get his land
ready for planting as fast as mortal man can, how
is the land to be got ready? It doesn’t plough itself,
does it, even at Perfection City?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see you will have to get rid of many prejudices,”
observed Mary Winkle. “Of course community-life
only comes easy to people who are adapted to it.
Wright and I are adapted. We like it. We shall stay
here. We shall succeed therefore. You and Brother
Ezra will have to go through a season of training
first. You both need it. I dare say you may hear
something that you will find useful to you to-morrow
from Wright. I will just mention to him where
your particular blindness seems to lie. Wright is a
very profound thinker. He has given great thought
to the subject of the Ultimate Perfection of People.
He can explain every step in the training of a perfect
communist, and show clearly just where everybody
has hitherto gone wrong in their attempts to realize
their ideal, and exactly what mistakes they have made.
I am glad you have come in time to hear his paper;
it will be of lasting good to you. You will be able
to profit by it, because you are in great need of proper
training. I dare say you need it more even than Ezra.
For, after all, he must have learned something from
us in the year he has been with us.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>MADAME MOROZOFF-SMITH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Academy at Perfection City was not a pretentious
building in anything but in name. It was
a plain wooden house, almost square, having a window
on three sides and a door on the fourth, facing south.
Inside there were several rough benches, two tables,
an iron stove, and a large easy chair, with a small desk
beside it, upon which stood a pair of candles. There
were no curtains and no carpets, absolutely no attempts
at beautifying the place. But the board-floor
was clean.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive dressed herself in a flutter of expectation
for her first visit to this abode of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I expect everybody will be there, because they’ll
all want to see you, little woman,” said her husband,
who, tired as he was after his day’s work, changed
his earth-stained clothes for a fresh suit. Olive wore
a white dress with lavender ribbons, and looked as
fresh as a daisy as she tripped along daintily holding
up her skirts. She wore the nattiest of boots over
the neatest of feet, altogether a bright and unexpected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>sight upon the glum-looking prairie. It was a quarter
of a mile to the Academy, down a road hardly
more than a cart-track, and across a dry gully where
there were no stepping stones.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Ezra had predicted, everybody had turned out
to welcome the new bride. Uncle David met her at
the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, little girl,” he said, “we’re all a-looking out
for you. Here’s Sister Mary Winkle, you’ve seen
her, and this is her husband, Brother Wright.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive shook hands with a dark, broad-shouldered
man who spoke in snaps as if he had been a dog. He
had glittering white teeth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ve been looking to have your husband back,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m sure you’re very kind,” murmured Olive
conventionally.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We needed him for the ploughing,” snapped
Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh indeed!” said Olive less cordially.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is the busy time of the year.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All times a-year is the busy time in my ’pinion
and ’sperience,” said Uncle David smiling comprehensively,
“but most everyone spares time one way
or ’nother to get married if they have a mind that
way. Come along an’ see Brother and Sister Dummy.
That ain’t their name, but we call ’em so, they’re
deaf and mostly dumb now. They’re real good folks
too.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>A sad-eyed red-haired man shook hands with her,
and a sad-eyed woman kissed her. They put into
her hand a slip of paper on which was written a message
of welcome.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They can talk a little, but they can’t hear one
mite, and they don’t like to talk, because they can’t
tell when they are whispering and when they are
yelling, and it makes strangers jump to hear them
sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive felt drawn towards this poor silent pair, but
did not know how to express her sympathy. There
were others in the room, but before she had time to
speak to them the door opened and Madame Morozoff-Smith
entered, and from that moment she seemed to
see no one else. Madame was a remarkable looking
woman. She was tall, large and fair, with keen grey
eyes, full red lips, and a mass of pale gold hair rising
over a forehead that was broad and smooth. A woman
of indeterminate age with an air of youthfulness and
command about her. She was dressed in a dark dress
and wore a bright bunch of ribbons in her hair. It
looked at first sight like a rose, only roses don’t grow
on the prairie in the month of May. She came straight
to where Olive was standing. She gave one the impression
of floating, for although a large woman, she
walked so lightly as to make no noticeable sound on
the wooden floor. Taking Olive’s two hands in her
warm large grasp, she kissed her on the forehead
murmuring “Welcome,” and then stepping back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>she said in a clear voice that vibrated through the
room:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! now I understand that hurried courtship
and swift marriage. I see what it was in Brother
Ezra’s case. It was love at first sight. You are very
pretty. I suppose, however, you know that very well.
It is a secret seldom kept from young girls.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was so startled by this unexpected address
that she blushed to the roots of her black hair. Ezra
stood looking down at his little wife smiling with
pleasure. He was delighted to think that Madame
found her so pretty. He had indeed thought her beautiful
from the first moment when his eyes had rested
on her, but then he loved her, and it was but natural
that in his eyes she should be lovely. Madame, however,
judged her unprejudiced, and yet if his delighted
heart had room for one regret, it was that Madame’s
praise had been so very public. If she had only whispered
it softly to him in that wonderful voice of hers,
which had often caught up his inmost thoughts and
clothed them in words of eloquence, how much more
precious would the tribute have been. He dismissed
the half-formed regret as unworthy, and took himself
to task for not exulting at this moment. The meeting
of Madame and Olive was an event in his life. Olive,
his sweet little rose-bud of a wife, on the one hand,
and Madame, his venerated, nay his worshipped, friend,
on the other. The one, the companion of his heart:
the other, the guide of his mind who embodied in herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>all that he held highest in the possibilities of
womanhood, his true and noble-hearted friend, his
inspired leader. How blest was the portion of him
who stood that night the husband of the one, the disciple
of the other! Ezra’s dark eyes shone with joy,
and his square chin quivered with the smiles that
lurked about his lips. He was not a handsome man,
perhaps, but there was something grand in the large
full forehead, strong eyebrows, and deep dark eyes.
His massive frame bespoke strength, which in itself
has always a great attraction for women.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Madame had addressed those words to the
new sister all the members of the Community had
scanned her narrowly, for the opinion of their leader
had immense weight with the Pioneers. The men
looked at Olive with increased admiration, and the
women with envy. Only Uncle David appeared disappointed
and wiped his face many times with his red
pocket-handkerchief saying, “Wal, wal, now,” in a
tone of earnest reproof.</p>

<p class='c010'>After this bewildering introduction in which her
vanity had been not a little excited, Olive received
a salutary check from the words of Brother Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Before beginning to read my paper,” said he,
“I should like to say a few words to the new sister
who has come among us. We expect soon to be having
new members join us so fast that perhaps we
shall not be able to specially mark the entrance of
each. But in this case there are peculiar reasons for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>exhortation. Sister Olive has not joined under ordinary
circumstances. She did not, like the rest of us,
feel a call to the higher life: she only came out of
personal affection for one of the members of the Community.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive looked with a shy glance towards her husband,
who took her hand in his for a moment, while
Uncle David, who sat at the end of the room near
Madame, said in a loud voice:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quite right, quite right, couldn’t ha’ had a better
reason.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Therefore it becomes our duty to impress upon
our new sister the principles which have been active
in forming this Community,” said Brother Wright,
without paying any heed to Uncle David’s interruption.
“Perfection City has been founded to teach
the world how to live. The old civilization has been
tried and found wanting. It is time for a new one.
Perfection City is the beginning of a new era. We
are the Pioneers of a new world. We shall show
the old and worn-out world how to banish evil from
life. We cannot perhaps banish all physical evil, and
for a time at least there may be sickness even among
us, but we shall at once set about freeing ourselves
from all the other troubles of life. There is nobody
in Perfection City who will get rich, and nobody will
ever be poor. We are all alike, and we shall none of
us envy our neighbours his belongings, simply because
everything belongs to all. The lesson we have to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>teach is the grandest the world ever saw, and when
men know what it is, I foresee a future before Perfection
City greater than that of any other city of the
world. Rome lasted a good long while, but Rome
didn’t possess the vital spark of life: Rome wasn’t
communistic, therefore Rome fell. Perfection City
won’t fall like that, but will go on teaching the world
after we, its founders, are all dead. But our memories
will live for the great things that we taught and
through our example have made possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Wright stopped for a few seconds, and
Uncle David said admiringly,</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have a fine command of words, Brother
Wright, and you have a way of making things sound
uncommon grand. It always does me good to hear
you talk of the grand future of our City; but we’ll
have to get up some houses, and bigger ones, ’fore
folks ’ull believe us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Uncle David was as simple as a child, or some
of his hearers might have suspected a sarcasm in his
words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rome wasn’t built in a day, as I’ve heard say,”
remarked Brother Green, with a strong English accent,
“and I shall be glad if our little village ever
grows to half its power and honour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brother Green, I should refuse to have anything
to say to the founding of another city like Rome,”
interrupted Brother Wright with decisiveness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me,” said Ezra in a shy hesitating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>manner, “that what we are here for is to demonstrate,
if we can, how a better life can be lived here than
is possible in the older communities, where circumstances
are too strong and too hampering for people
to rise above them. The older civilization has done
much, it has raised our race to a high standard. What
we want to do is to carry on that work, and above
all to bring everyone within reach of the best that life
has to offer. The older civilization has left so many
stranded ones, who have lost their strength in the wild
struggle; while we hope to bring all along equally
and give to each a share of happiness. As usual, my
friends, when I try to express my ideas I find that
someone else has already put them into incomparably
finer language than I can ever command. It has been
so again. I find that our great poet, Walt Whitman,
has said better than I can what I feel. May I quote
him to you?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>‘Have the elder races halted?</div>
      <div class='line'>Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?</div>
      <div class='line'>We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>Pioneers! O pioneers!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Ezra sat down after reciting his verse, and his wife
looked at him with glowing eyes. He had not said
much, but his words had seemed to her so much fuller
of thought and feeling than the easy monotonous flow
from Brother Wright. That individual himself had
not received Ezra’s remarks with quite so much delight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>It was Brother Wright’s nature to see fight and
contradiction in all things, even the most pacific. His
eyes would flash and his black beard bristle in argument,
almost as if he were a dog preparing to fight,
and if one might be permitted to liken any Pioneer
to one of the canine species, the bull-dog would undoubtedly
be the variety most nearly resembling Brother
Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see that we need be beholden to anyone,
poet or otherwise,” he said sharply, “for our opinions
or sentiments. We have found them for ourselves,
just as we have founded our City. It is our work,
both opinions and practice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think,” said Madame, rising and speaking with
a deep clear voice, which a slight foreign accent
seemed to render only the more attractive, “I think
I see better than they do themselves where our two
brothers agree. Brother Ezra, with that diffidence
which strong natures often exhibit, thought he found
in the lines of another man his own ideas more succinctly
embodied than they would have been in his
own words. Brother Ezra should not doubt his powers.
Speech comes slowly to those who most deeply
think, but he should consider how much we benefit
by his words and how grateful we are to him for them.
Brother Wright, it seems to me that you, perhaps,
do not sufficiently appreciate the efforts of others who
have gone before us on this road. We are not the first
who have been discontented with the actual order of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>things, nor are we the first who have striven to make
life brighter and easier. In all ages there have been
those penetrated with these thoughts, and in different
ways men, and women too, have striven earnestly,
devotedly, to realize these ideas. Some indeed have
imagined they had found a solution of all doubts and
difficulties, and have in perfect good faith and self-satisfaction
buried themselves in convents and monasteries
and have ‘roll’d the psalm to wintry skies,’ and
have ‘built them fanes of fruitless prayer.’ We have
come to different conclusions by following a different
road. We do not shut ourselves out of the world,
rather we endeavour to raise it by showing a living
example of what may be done now, in this age, by
human beings such as we are. But if we are to succeed
we must not reject the experience, nor fail to
profit by the example, of others who have gone before
us and felt earnestly on this subject.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame paused for a moment, and her keen glance
rested upon the small assembly. Each individual
seemed to feel that she was looking at him or at
her. Certainly each member was looking intently at
her. She seldom made speeches to them; she only
interposed her observations, as on this occasion, between
the speakers; but the last word usually remained
with her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brother Wright, will you now read us your paper,
as the evening is passing and we are all anxious to
hear it. What is the title and subject?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“The Ultimate Perfection of Being is the title,”
said Brother Wright, “and I think that pretty well
sums up the subject also.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So apparently thought the audience, which
resigned itself to a severe mental excursion into
the unknown regions of Brother Wright’s imaginative
metaphysics. Some of them fell out very
soon, finding the road harder to follow than they
had foreseen; but Brother Wright kept sturdily
on, unheeding the signs of weakness and disaffection
as betrayed by movings of feet and stifled
yawns.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive, not being able to understand what Brother
Wright was saying, employed herself in watching
Madame, who sat motionless beside her table, resting
her head upon her supple white hand. At her feet
lay what seemed to be a large brown rug, but was in
fact her dog Balthasar, a blood-hound, who always
stayed with her and was as gentle as a lamb, notwithstanding
his name and breed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brother Green! That’s the second time you’ve
snored,” suddenly exclaimed Brother Wright in the
midst of his reading. Everybody was wide awake in
an instant. Madame hid a smile with her hand, but
not before Olive had noticed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brother Green is perhaps tired. His work is very
hard,” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, the fact is I had to put a new point to
the ploughshare this morning before I went to fetch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>my load of iron, and I began work before daybreak.
I am very tired.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Green was the blacksmith of Perfection
City, an industrious hard-working man who thought
life would show him a fairer side on the prairie than
it had ever done in the far-away village in Sussex
where he was born.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that it might be better to have our gatherings
rather shorter now,” said Madame softly. “The
workers in our little hive are all tired. I wish I
could do more of the labour that is needed. I would
gladly——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame was interrupted by a sharp rap on the
table, a signal from Brother Huntley that he wanted
to speak. He was the deaf and dumb man. She instantly
rose and bowed to him with singular graciousness.
Madame’s manner towards the deaf brethren
was all that was exquisite. Huntley stood up
and began in a voice almost inaudible which rose
by sudden degrees to the intensity of a steam-whistle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to know when we’re going to get our
corn planted? We’re behindhand; most other folk’s
corn is in already.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As usual, Brother Huntley has something practical
to say,” observed Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t know we were discussing quite another
subject, else his remark would have been rude
and irrelevant,” said Wright, vexed at this cutting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>into his paper on the ultimate perfection of his and
everybody’s being.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think it would be very useful to see what we
can do about the corn,” said the blacksmith. “If we
are late the chances are there’ll be another drought in
July, and our crop won’t be first-class.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is anyone’s land ready for planting?” inquired
Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“None as I know of, except Brother Dummy’s,”
said Uncle David. “He’s more forward nor anybody:
always first in work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, poor deaf creature! he can’t do anything
but dumbly work like a——” began Brother
Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My land is ready for planting,” burst in Brother
Huntley with a scream.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then it shall be planted to-morrow,” cried Madame.
“I’ll go myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You!” exclaimed Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, child. Don’t you think I can work as
well as any other woman?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She rapidly wrote a few words on a slip of paper
and passed it to Brother Huntley, who read it, nodded
with satisfaction, and said: “Five o’clock in the morning!”
in a voice so low that no one knew he was
speaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose he begins work about six?” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, he don’t, he’s mighty spry,” said old Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Ruby, who lived near the Huntleys. “I hear him
a-movin’ off with his plough every morning at five
by the clock. He’s terrible sot on his work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I shall be there ready to go to work at five
o’clock in the morning, and I shall begin by going
to bed now, so as to be able to give a good day’s
work. Good-night, friends all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She rose, included them all in a sweeping salute
and left the room as lightly as she had entered. Balthasar
rose and slowly followed her.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Madame left the room the meeting broke
up. No one felt inclined to linger when she was gone.
It was from her they drew their interest in each other,
as well as their belief in themselves and in Perfection
City. She possessed the secret of influencing people
without seeming to do so. The thought that she was
going out on the land at five in the morning to plant
corn made everyone ten times more eager to work
than heretofore.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wright and his independent spouse, Mary Winkle,
were infected by her example as they went
home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Wright, don’t you go and do any more
essaying till the crop is in. I think people oughtn’t
to write except in winter time,” said Mary Winkle
with firmness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never believed in nothing but manual work.
Why, if I did, I should be still slaving away on that
farm out in Illinois, instead of joining a community
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>here where one can follow the bent of his higher nature,
to the advantage of his neighbours as well as of
himself,” said Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, let that be,” said Mary hastily, recognising
her own words and oft-expressed opinions, but not
quite knowing what to do with them—a predicament
not unexampled among theoretical philosophers,
“but see and be out on the land to-morrow as early
as anyone. Are you ready for the planting? Because
I’ll go out and plant if you are.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, my drills won’t be ready for the planting
till day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I’ll go and plant on Brother Dummy’s
piece along with Madame.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d better not. You’re not fit for such work.
You’ll get sick and not be able to cook me any supper
when I come home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I shan’t get sick. I ain’t going to let
any person beat me at work, when I set my mind
to it, and she in her long skirts too! I’ll show
her the advantage of the reformed dress anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus the Wright and Winkle pair on their way
home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And will she really plant corn?” asked Olive in
some curiosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly she will. Madame never despised
work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I don’t despise work, but she seems such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>a fine lady to go out on the land and plant corn just
like a negro woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is one of the things our life here is intended
to show, dearie, that no one is too grand for any honest
work that he or she is physically capable of performing.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>CORN PLANTING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Punctual to the minute, there was Madame with
her bag of corn on her left arm, following Brother
Huntley and his plough-horses to the field, in the
damp white fog of sunrise. Balthasar in deep disgust
was there too, as in duty bound, but he had not a
wag for anybody. How could a rational dog be in
good spirits at that hour of the morning! Madame
was dressed in a short calico frock well up to her
ankles. Her fair hair was loosely wisped at the back
of her head, and a large straw hat, tied down with
a green gauze veil, made her look at once comfortable
in the fog and ready for the expected sunshine. There
were no corn-planters at Perfection City: farm-machinery
was not then so plentiful on the prairie as
now, and money was if possible scarcer. Corn planting
was, therefore, done by hand. Brother Dummy’s
drills of longitude were already ploughed, and he
began on the drills of latitude forthwith. Into the
hollows made by the intersection of these two sets
of drills Madame was to drop three grains of corn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>neither more nor less. It is dizzying work. After
walking up and down the drills for hours one becomes
oppressed by the never-ceasing square constantly recurring
every two steps. The check pattern bewilders
you, and you begin to wonder how a chess-man would
feel if, endowed with sensibility and the power of
motion, he had to march up and down his chess-board,
always keeping to the lines for hours at a stretch.</p>

<p class='c010'>About seven o’clock Mary Winkle came upon the
scene and plodded and planted for four hours. The
sun was blazing down upon them pitilessly, and the
parching south wind blew the fine black dust up from
the rich dry soil, until their eyes and ears and noses
were full of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The field which they were planting was on the
extreme verge of the community-land, far away from
the houses. These were somewhat clustered towards
the centre of the holding, which consisted of two sections
or a little over twelve hundred acres. The
workers, therefore, were a long way from home, considerably
over a mile, and since corn planting entails
ceaseless walking through heavy ploughed land, it had
been settled that their dinner should be brought out
to them, so as to enable the workers to rest during
the whole dinner hour. Olive and Mrs. Ruby were
to supply the necessary food, and the former, aided
by Napoleon Pompey, was to bring it to the field at
eleven o’clock. The little grove of locust trees just
beginning to grow beside the far spring was the trysting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>place. Water would thus be handy, and the horses’
feed was already put there by the provident Brother
Huntley. A little before the hour Olive and her black
attendant arrived at the grove, bringing their load of
food, and Olive set down her big tin can with a sigh
of relief. Her arms ached with carrying it, for it was
heavy and the way was long. Napoleon Pompey had
carried two cans, each heavier than hers, but the lad
seemed to feel no inconvenience from the load. Olive
looked at him with envy and thought with contempt
of her own muscles which appeared so inefficient. As
she unpacked the food, it seemed to her that nothing
she had learnt at Smyrna and could best do, was
wanted on the prairie, and she remembered with some
amusement and not a little bitterness Mary Winkle’s
words about food for the mind. At this moment she
reflected that all the learning in the world was not so
much needed by that philosophical lady as the very
gross and material food which was being taken out
of the heavy tin cans and laid on the grass. The
working-party, men, women and horses, arrived while
Olive was thus engaged. Mary Winkle instantly sat
down and leaned against a tree and threw off her sunbonnet.
Her thin black hair was matted down to her
temples, her cheeks were yellow, and her eyes looked
dull. Madame also took off her hat and veil and shook
up the coil of hair on her head with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does your head ache too?” said Mary Winkle
wearily.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Not in the least,” replied Madame. “A sunbonnet
is a bad shelter against heat. You should
wear a good hat, it is far better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder how you can bear all that hair on your
head. Why don’t you cut it off?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, it is an admirable protection against both
heat and cold,” said Madame laughing. “It is my
greatest comfort.” She might have added her greatest
beauty.</p>

<p class='c010'>The food which Olive brought was most appetising,
roast chicken, hot corn-bread, and pumpkin pies,
with plenty of milk and water to drink. Before eating
Madame went to the spring to wash her hands and
face, and Mary Winkle sat limply against the tree
trunk with her eyes shut.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eat something, it will revive you,” said Olive,
looking with pity upon her sallow cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t feel hardly able to eat,” she said in a
weak voice. “It seems to me I don’t ever want to
open my eyes again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are overworking yourself,” said Olive, “you
should not attempt this field work: it is beyond your
strength.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! and let her see me give in?” said Mary
Winkle with reviving spirit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame came up at this moment looking as
fresh as a lily: she glanced sharply at Sister Mary.
“You appear very much exhausted,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Sister Mary raised her head and opened her eyes,
but did not speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a pity you don’t take wine,” she continued,
sitting down and beginning on her piece of chicken
with relish. “A good glass of Burgundy would set
you up in no time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sister Mary herself sat up at this.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t touch wine, no, not if I was dying,”
she said resolutely.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame smiled. “I didn’t recommend it because
you were dying: wine as everything else is then useless:
but because you look weak. I suggested a medicine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As a medicine it is worse than useless, and as a
drink I scorn to take a rank poison.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poisons are sometimes given as medicine, witness
strychnine in small doses for certain forms of dyspepsia,
and I believe satisfactorily,” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wine is worse than strychnine, because more
insidious in its action and more liable to abuse,” said
Mary Winkle decisively, as she took the tin cup of
milk and water handed her by Olive, and drank it
with eagerness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, at all events admit that wine has been
of benefit to you on this occasion,” observed Madame
smiling. “I merely mentioned it to you, and you
look already revived and more like yourself. Doesn’t
she, Sister Olive?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was the milk and water did it,” said Sister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Mary Winkle hurriedly, at which Madame smiled
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Dummy and Napoleon Pompey now came
up to the group of women. They had been watering
and unharnessing the horses who were at the present
moment munching their corn. The white man, although
dirty as a ploughman would be after half a
day’s hard work, sat down promptly beside Mary Winkle
and helped himself to a leg of chicken: the negro
boy stood aside doubtfully, eyeing the group and the
food with longing looks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come along, N. P.,” said Olive brightly, “sit
down there.” She pointed to a place on the other
side of Mary Winkle, where there seemed a good opening
in front of a huge piece of corn-bread.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, if you please,” said Sister Mary, rising to
her feet with resentment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Olive flushing
with surprise. “Napoleon Pompey won’t bite you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have never sat down to eat beside a negro, and
I don’t feel inclined to begin now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the lad sit beside me,” said Madame gently.
“I have seen people of too many shades of colour
and no colour to mind a little extra dash of black.
Come here, boy, come and have this piece of bread
and meat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Napoleon Pompey grinning with all his white teeth
sprang to the place beside Madame, and buried those
same teeth eagerly in his chunk of bread. Mary Winkle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>sat down again and leaned against the tree. Olive’s
face took a deeper tinge of red and her eyes snapped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you consider yourself made of such fine clay
that it won’t bear contact with a negro?” she asked
hotly. “It seems to me a little of what used to be
called Christian charity might come in useful here. I
never aspired to the heights of Perfection City people,
but I never refused the rights of brotherhood to the
negro simply because of the curl of his hair or the
colour of his skin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am quite willing to give them all their rights
and will be glad to see them educated and all that,
but I never sat at dinner with a negro, and I am not
going to begin now,” said Mary Winkle setting her
thin pale lips with the utmost stubbornness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I call it perfectly monstrous,” retorted
Olive, “and you setting yourself up to show the better
life and all the rest of it! I should have thought the
first thing to do before teaching the highest perfection
was to practise the simplest justice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you, Sister Olive,” said Madame’s cool sweet
voice, “will have to learn to respect the prejudices
of other people even when they run counter to your
most cherished theories. I do not myself share the
feeling of repulsion that Sister Mary has in this case,
but I respect it. I would suggest to you to do the
same. It is an inconvenient fact, perhaps, that people
do not all think alike, but it is one that must be resolutely
faced nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Olive was silent under this reproof, but she looked
angrily at Mary Winkle from time to time, and revenged
herself by feeding up Napoleon Pompey and
petting him to an alarming extent, much to the delight
of that young darkie who ate until he seemed
to ooze out unctuous joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Dummy ate, as he worked, silently, conscientiously,
continuously. Olive was amazed at the
amount he seemed able to consume, while of milk and
water he drank half a gallon or thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can he do it?” said Olive in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You forget,” replied Madame, “that he has been
following that plough for six long hours, and the
dry wind raised such a dust around him that he must
have swallowed a vast quantity of it in the course of
the day. It takes a good deal to slake the thirst after
such a dust visitation as that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Brother Dummy had eaten and drunk his
fill he lay down on the grass and went instantly to
sleep. The three women looked at him for a moment
or two.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He seems to have very little enjoyment in his
life,” said Olive compassionately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But then he has also few sorrows,” said Madame.
“The high lights are wanting, perhaps, but so are the
dark shadows. His life is like a grey landscape. It
has a beauty of its own, but not everyone can see it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To live in eternal silence seems to me the most
awful curse,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“I can imagine many a worse one,” replied Madame,
looking out from among the few bare trees
away across the open prairie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What could be worse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, for example, to know that someone you
loved did not love you. To have to shut up your heart
within iron doors, and never open them to let it out.
That would be worse than to be denied the power of
speech, which after all can now be supplemented in
many ways by artificial means. Brother Huntley is
not actively unhappy, I should judge. He and his
wife have always appeared to me to be a very united
couple.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They cannot quarrel, at all events,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, not, at least, in the ordinary way,” replied
Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Brother Dummy awoke after his little
snooze, he got up, looked at the sun to see what time
of day it was, and then signed to Napoleon Pompey
to rouse up. That young person was lethargic, owing
to his anaconda-like meal, accordingly Brother Dummy
roused him with his foot. The darkie rolled over
and said “Yah!” and started for the horses, who were
nodding over their corn-cobs, now nibbled down to
the smallest dimensions. Olive, whose resentment at
the slight put upon Napoleon Pompey by Mary Winkle
urged her to identify herself with the negro boy,
walked away with him and Brother Dummy to watch
the hitching up. Madame employed herself in throwing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>scraps of bread to Balthasar, who would have much
preferred eating the chicken bones, only that was a
debauch not permitted to a dog of his manners. Mary
Winkle looked hopelessly along those weary furrows,
up and down which it would be her duty to march
again, dropping her seeds of corn as before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going to work all the afternoon?” she
asked of her companion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I think so. We shall get this field planted
and covered in by sun-down, I should think. And
that will be a great piece of work done. We cannot
afford to let the individualists beat us at corn planting,
can we? We must do at least as well as they, and I
should hope we might do better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know how you can stand so much heat
and hard work,” said Mary, “and in that dress too.
Why, if I were to attempt to work in long skirts I
should be dead in a week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mind my dress at all,” said Madame.
“It never bothers me. I don’t think about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But don’t you think about it when your back
aches?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It never does.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t understand it,” says Mary once more.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suspect that the reason you American women
find your dress such a burden is because you are so
weak yourselves,” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“American women accomplish as much or more
than any others, I should say,” observed Mary.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“Precisely, but not from their muscular strength.
They work out of their nerves, and that is why they
never last any length of time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame finished her day’s work at six o’clock, and
then walked home humming a German dance tune to
herself. Mary Winkle stopped at four o’clock, and
dragged herself home to bed with a fearsome headache,
still puzzling how it was that her perfect dress had
not done better for her in that day’s trial. She did
not know that all her scientific dressing was as nothing
compared with the robust vitality, which Madame
brought with her from another land, and which, running
in such vigorous beats through her blood, was
inherited from generations of strong healthy ancestors.
Madame’s father was a Russian colonel noted
for his size and strength and also for his wildness.
Her mother was a pretty English girl, who had nothing
to bequeath to her daughter but health, personal
beauty, and this piece of advice: “Never stake your
happiness on any man, it always brings disaster to
the woman.” Mary Winkle’s mother, on the other
hand, was a nervous invalid at thirty, and her father
was a dyspeptic dietetic reformer, who pinned his salvation
on never eating salt. Small wonder, therefore,
that the daughter of the one pair should be able to
plant corn all day long and walk lightly home at evening,
while the offspring of the other pair could do
only three quarters of a day’s work, after which headache
and nervous exhaustion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>It was the custom of the Pioneers to send once a
week to Union Mills in order to do their necessary
marketing and to get the post, which came there twice
a week from Kansas City by stage-coach. The subject
of the post was one that had been rather hotly
debated at Perfection City, although to the outsider
it would seem a very harmless topic, and not fruitful
of division. The fact was, however, that there was
only one member of the Community who showed any
eagerness about getting letters regularly and often,
and that member was Madame. She indeed did receive
a most unconscionable number of letters and periodicals,
so the other members thought. She got several
American Magazines, such as the Atlantic Monthly
and Harper’s, but she also received English papers,
and French ones, and occasionally German ones as
well. The Community thought, but did not dare to
give public expression to the thought, that Madame
should have rested content with the mental sustenance
provided by themselves for home consumption.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Brother Wright in particular felt himself equal to the
task of providing everybody with all they needed in
the way of correct views upon even the highest subjects.
But Madame, although she listened with politeness
and apparent attention to what he had to say,
found this sustenance too meagre for the wants of her
nature. Moreover she took a deep interest in the affairs
of the outside world, an interest almost offensive
to persons who prided themselves upon having risen
above the world and all its concerns. It was really
humiliating to think that the leading spirit of their
Community should occupy her mind with the relations
between Prussia and Austria, when such questions as
affected the future of humanity and of Perfection City
were what filled their souls. She even evinced a keen
interest in the career and personality of the Prussian
minister, Bismarck, and that, too, when Brother
Wright was willing to give her the light of his
thoughts upon all really important questions. It was
painful to the feeling of the Pioneers, who were all
in all to themselves and wished to be so to others, but
they had to put up with it, since Madame was their
leader and, moreover, the only one who had a purse
with some money in it. Ezra was the only member of
the Community who sided with Madame in her taste
for reading the new books and the latest periodicals.
He and she had that taste, with many others, in common,
and it drew them together in an especial degree.
On his last trip East during the winter, when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>had been so unexpectedly delayed, as they now knew,
by meeting with his fate in the shape of Olive, one of
his commissions had been to bring back a box of books,
which were now arranged in neat shelves in Madame’s
private sitting-room. And yet notwithstanding all
these books, a hundred or more, the steady stream of
papers, periodicals, and magazines continued as before,
and had to be fetched regularly from Union
Mills.</p>

<p class='c010'>The brethren took it in turns to go to the town,
which was some ten miles distant, and they always combined
some useful business with the fetching of the
letters. Brother Wright was a frequent messenger,
for he liked going better than Ezra did, while of course
Brother Dummy was precluded by his affliction from
going, and Brother Carpenter was hopelessly unable
to drive horses. Some of the women generally contrived
to find an excuse for going to Union Mills, for
women like to get away from the petty cares of house
and home, a peculiarity from which the sisters of
Perfection City were by no means exempt. In particular
Mrs. Ruby, invariably called Aunt Ruby, loved
to go. She thus got a chance of seeing new faces and
talking with new people. She would not for worlds
have confessed that she was tired of the restricted
society of Perfection City, but she knew so well what
each had to say, that it was refreshing to go out sometimes
into the world and meet people whose ideas
could not always be guessed beforehand.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>It so happened that the day after the corn planting
it became necessary to go to Union Mills in order to
take a grist of corn to be ground. Madame suggested
that Brother Wright should go, while Brother Dummy
took up his plough-handles and finished the field
the former was preparing for the corn. Mary Winkle,
still prostrated by the previous day’s hard work, urged
her spouse to go, “For then,” said she, “if you ain’t
here I needn’t get any dinner. I’ll just send Willette
over to Sister Olive’s for dinner, and I needn’t stir
till milking time.” This seemed a happy arrangement,
and her husband set off shortly after breakfast,
picking up Aunt Ruby as he passed her cottage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be you lonesome living in that house by yourself?”
asked Brother Wright as they jogged along
over the prairie, for it had struck him as very lonely
that morning as he drove up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, I ain’t lonely, least not most whiles,”
answered Aunt Ruby, an alert little old woman, not
unlike a bird in her quick movements. “In the
summer-time there’s allus the chickens to see to an’
feed an’ ten’, an’ chickens is powerful spry an’ talkin’
birds. They most allus has somethin’ to scold an’
chatter ’bout, chickens an’ hens has, an’ cocks. Then
in the winter I hev the clock tickin’ loud o’ evenin’s,
an’ that’s most as good as a pusson in the room, an’
there’s allus the cat, an’ mostly the kettle singin’ on
the stove. Come to think on’t, there’s a heap o’ company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>in a house like mine, if you on’y has ears to hear
an’ un’erstan’ what is said by beasts an’ things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet notwithstanding this “heap o’ company” Aunt
Ruby dearly loved a good gossip with the saddler’s
wife at Union Mills, whenever that luxury was attainable.
On the present occasion Aunt Ruby had a real
good time, for Brother Wright was delayed longer
than usual, first in order to get some harness mended,
and afterwards to have a shoe replaced that suddenly
showed signs of coming off one of the horses. Thus
it was very near sun-down before they left Union
Mills. Aunt Ruby, owing in large measure to her
gossip, and also partly to an exceptionally strong cup
of tea, was in a highly nervous and excitable frame
of mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had Brother Wright, she asked, heard of that
rumour about the Cherokees? And did he think there
was any danger of their leaving their Reservation and
going on the war-path? Brother Wright, who had a
poor opinion of Indians, and a worse one of the way
in which the white men had treated them, thought on
the whole that the rumour might be considered false.
This comforted Aunt Ruby, to whom the word “Injun”
suggested torture and death and all sorts of
horrors. She remained comforted until she remembered
that other rumour—about the raid of border
ruffians from out of Missouri. Brother Wright thought
it highly probable that this rumour might prove to be
true. Missouri men had raided Kansas more than once,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and it was possible they might do so again at any moment.
With conversation such as this they came to
the end of the daylight and the beginning of the trees
around Cotton Wood Creek about the same time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be glad when we are safe over this ford
and out of the dark wood beyond,” said Brother
Wright, trying to urge his horses along, but he had
a heavy load of timber and coal and some iron bars
for smith-work.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ain’t it near here that those people over beyond
Jacksonville got robbed?” asked Aunt Ruby, nervously
peering about in the gloom with her weak old
eyes. At this moment some distant creature made a
shrill scream or howl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! what was that,” exclaimed Aunt Ruby nervously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was a prairie wolf, I guess,” answered
Brother Wright quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Silence followed, except for the creaking of the
waggon, the straining of the horses at their traces,
and an occasional clang made by one of the bars of
iron which was not sufficiently wedged up with hay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If those Missouri border ruffians came to Perfection
City, do you reckon our principles would save
us from being robbed?” asked Aunt Ruby. “Most
everybody knows as we are non-resistants.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think our principles would stand in the
way of a Missouri man. More likely they would take
advantage of them. They are mean cusses, and are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>used to riding rough-shod over principles and rights.
It is a recognised thing everywhere that women and
children are non-resistants, yet that does not save ’em
from being raided and robbed by border ruffians.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you think they would rob us, peaceful folks
as ha’n’t no arms nor nothin’?” asked Aunt Ruby
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess they would try,” replied Brother Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I think as we oughter reconsider our principles
a mite,” said Aunt Ruby. “For if we are robbed
and killed by folks as can’t un’erstan’ the higher life,
we shan’t be able to teach the world nothin’. An’
what’s the good o’ principles when you’re dead an’
gone an’ undergroun’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is so,” assented Brother Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t never think on’t in this light afore,” said
Aunt Ruby. “It ’pears to me as how we should
meet together an’ try an’ settle some way as how
we can keep our principles an’ yet live on the
prairie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess you’ve pretty nearly said the truth,” said
Brother Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What we hev to do is to live here an’ show ’em
our principles at work, an’ not die straightway afore
we’ve done anything to improve mankind. That’s
my view,” said Aunt Ruby. “What do you think,
Brother Wright?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Instead of answering Brother Wright pulled up
short and looked intently in front of him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“What’s the matter?” exclaimed Aunt Ruby in
a high-pitched voice of alarm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush!” replied her companion, “don’t make a
noise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Ruby’s heart began to beat violently. “Do
you see anything?” she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see a man over there by the road, sitting on
horseback with his right arm out pointing towards the
waggon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! brother, I wish you had a carnal weapon
of defence,” said Aunt Ruby in a shaking voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have,” replied Brother Wright, pulling an uncommonly
useful-looking Colt’s revolver from his
breeches pocket. “I always carry one in case of
Injuns.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again they sat silent for a moment, the horses
shook their heads, and one of them stamped a foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who goes there?” hailed Brother Wright in a
loud defiant voice. “Drop that right arm of yours
or I’ll fire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>No answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The figure sat motionless, the right hand still
raised in that menacing attitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am a man of my word,” said Brother Wright,
rising to his feet and sighting his revolver steadily
on the figure, while to Aunt Ruby he said, “Hold on
tight, the horses will jump.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A shot rang out on the still night air. The horses
nearly jumped out of their skins with fright, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>would certainly have run away, only the waggon was
very heavy, and they decided to run in different directions.
Hence they only jerked each other almost
to the ground and then stood still amazed and trembling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better make sure,” said Brother Wright, emptying
another barrel at the figure which appeared to remain
motionless in the uncertain foggy light. This
time the horses came to the same conclusion and tried
to turn round abruptly, but the attempt was expertly
frustrated by Brother Wright and a cowhide whip of
exceptional stinging power. Having thus reduced the
horses to reason, he again turned his attention to the
figure and saw with amazement that it still sat on
horseback in the same spot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I swan!” said Brother Wright, rubbing
his eyes. “That beats all! It can’t be a mortal
man, or he would have either dropped or returned
fire. I guess I’ll drive on and do no more shooting
this time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stowed his pistol away in his pocket and
drove on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hadn’t you better keep the weapon handy?”
suggested Aunt Ruby. “You might lay it down in
my lap, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thank’ee,” replied Brother Wright. “I don’t
generally give that sort of thing to women to hold
for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He pulled up at a little opening just near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>ford, where the faint light of a crescent moon showed
between the bare branches of the trees, and a sort
of water-fog hung along the elder bushes by the banks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is the spot he was standing,” remarked
Wright, “the exact spot. I guess I’ll just look and
see if there is any trail. The ground is soft about
here and should show up pretty clear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He descended from the waggon and carefully examined
the side of the road, but could see nothing.
There was a large stump with a broken branch sticking
out which attracted his attention, and he walked
around it a couple of times, surveying it critically in
the uncertain light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I swan!” he exclaimed, after the third
inspection. “I didn’t think I could have been mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he climbed back into the waggon, and said,
“Gee-up!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you fin’ any tracks o’ robbers?” asked his
companion anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” replied Brother Wright, “no tracks of robbers,
but I lighted on the trail of a doggauned fool.
Guess we’ll not say much about the attack made on
our waggon, at Little Cotton Wood Creek.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t mention it at all,” remarked Aunt Ruby,
“’cause it might frighten the folks up to Perfection
City an’ make ’em uneasy ’bout coming to Union
Mills.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Wright only chuckled in reply, possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>because his whole attention was required at this juncture
to get his horses and waggon safely through the
water, for it was certainly very dark in that bottom-land.
Once the creek was crossed and the high prairie
reached, it became easy enough to see by the light
of the new moon and the stars, and the pair reached
Perfection City in safety, although very late.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Wright was very eager to unravel the
mystery of that horseman at the ford on Little Cotton
Wood Creek, so he made a private expedition thither
on horseback as soon as he could frame an excuse for
a morning’s absence. He went to the place whence
he had first seen the alarming stranger, half closed
his sharp grey eyes, and looked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I swan!” he remarked, as this expression
seemed somehow to relieve his feelings. By daylight
there was nothing suspicious to be seen, but the old
stump with the broken branch sticking out from it
straight towards the spectator. Brother Wright surveyed
this stump critically and came to the conclusion
that with the help of darkness, a slight mist, a
new moon, and a nervous companion, the old stump
might take on an alarming aspect. He rode up to the
stump, got off his horse, and examined it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like to know that I hit him plumb with
both bullets anyhow,” remarked he, with a grin most
unbecoming to a Perfection City non-resistant. He
had hit “him” plumb, but so had other people, and
the amazed Brother Wright counted no less than seventeen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>bullet holes, both old and new, in the body of
that long suffering stump.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I be jiggered!” said Brother Wright as he
mounted his horse. “What a sight of blamed fools
there must be in the world!” and with this comforting
reflection he rode home, and ever after held his
peace about the episode on the ford of Little Cotton
Wood Creek. And so likewise did Aunt Ruby, that
talkative old lady. But sometimes, when she and
Brother Wright looked into each other’s eyes, they
grinned a little sheepishly, showing that the recollection
of it had not quite faded from their minds.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>WILLETTE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Willette, the only child of the Wright and Winkle
pair, was a young person of considerable character,
which had undergone little of the attempted modification
which we call education. At the time of
Olive’s arrival at Perfection City this child was about
eleven years old, and was as wild a specimen of a
girl as could be easily found even on the prairie. Her
mother had endeavoured to clothe her in garments
known as the “reform-dress,” and had made her a
suit of lilac calico, consisting of short tunic, and full-gathered
trousers of the prescribed pattern. Willette
had put on these things and had promptly complained
of “scratchiness” around the neck and arm-holes,
owing probably to deficiency of skill on the part of
her mother in the making of the said garments. Shortly
afterwards, being called upon to do some cattle-hunting,
Willette had set out in all the pride of her
new clothes to ride down some young steers who were
proving refractory. The steers took shelter in the
bottom-land along Little Cotton Wood Creek, and skilfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>hid themselves in the brushwood there, among
the trailing wild vines and the spiky wilder plums
which formed a very good barrier against pursuing
man. Willette plunged bravely into the brush, and
after a fierce struggle returned with one steer and
half her dress. The other half remained in the brush
along with the rest of the steers. Repeated onslaughts
reduced her almost to nakedness, but she brought home
the full complement of steers and an abundant assortment
of scratches on her legs. After that Willette
had enough of her mother’s system of dress, and accordingly
she evolved one of her own.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ain’t agoin’ to cattle-hunt in no more o’ your
cobwebs, Ma,” explained this young person. “I
reckon I’ll go a-ridin’ like a boy next time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Willette appropriated one of her father’s pants
made of the material known as hickory, which is supposed
to resist any tear or strain. The current legend
attached to real out-and-out hickory is as follows. A
farmer arrayed in hickory was one day rooting out
old stumps from a newly-cleared field with a new
patent plough. He came to a regular stunner which
jerked the plough clean out of the land. He backed
up, took a good hold of the plough-handles, gave a
mighty yell to the horses, and drove the plough clean
through the stump, which split open in the middle.
The plough and the man passed through, but the
stump closed up again and caught his hickory trousers.
The horses strained at the collar, but the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>would not let go of the plough, nor would the stump
relinquish its grasp of the hickory trousers. So he
rested his horses a spell, took a big breath, and said
“Hallelujah!” whereupon the horses went forward
with a bound and brought plough, man, trousers, and
stump along with them!</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a garment of this incomparable material that
Willette appropriated to her use. She cut off the legs
until the length suited her stature, regardless of the
fit of the waist, clothed the upper part of her body
in a pink check shirt, put a boy’s cap upon her head,
and announced her intention of henceforth dressing
like that. She was a chip off the old block with a vengeance,
and Mary Winkle, after one affrighted gasp,
was obliged to admit that her own principles, as put
into practice by her daughter, were too much for her.
Wright laughed immensely, and said she was a boy
now and would do first-rate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Willette was totally uneducated, could not write
her name and could scarcely read, but she did not
lack for intelligence. She knew the hour of the day,
by looking at the sun, as well as a negro, and
she could distinguish a horse from a cow at four
miles distance. She knew every beast for miles
around, and to whom it belonged, and could remember
for a month every cow she had come across
on the prairie and which way it was heading. She
understood the moods and intentions of all kinds
of animals almost as if she was one of the species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>herself, and she never was at fault on a cattle-trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive found immense amusement in talking to
Willette, who expressed herself with the utmost freedom
upon all subjects in language which would have
done credit to a nigger. The child, on the other hand,
had a supreme contempt for Olive’s abilities and attainments,
which seemed ludicrously deficient, but
felt a kindly patronising sort of regard for her, and
liked to look at her pretty face and touch her smooth
round cheeks. The pair were therefore often together,
and Willette undertook to teach her friend to ride,
provided she would get some sensible clothes and ride
in the only way that Willette imagined it possible
for a two-legged human being to bestride a quadruped.
Olive therefore made herself a bewitching riding-habit
with Turkish trousers, and rode a high-peaked
Mexican saddle, out of which even a sack of meal
could not tumble if it tried. As soon as Olive began
to feel confidence in herself and her horse, she enjoyed
the riding immensely. She claimed the refusal of a
horse on every possible opportunity when one could
be spared from the farm work. Ezra, delighted to see
her so pleased with a healthy exercise, encouraged
her to go cattle-hunting with Willette, and enjoyed
the spirited reports which she used to bring home from
these exhilarating expeditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do wish I had a pony of my very own which
I could take out whenever I wanted a ride, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>would be always there for me,” said Olive one day
to Ezra after she had been riding by herself on Rebel.
Ezra was hoeing up the newly sprouted sweet-corn, and
the horses were not at work on the land. In his inmost
heart he re-echoed the wish, and would at that
moment have given anything to be an individualist
and be able to say: “Darling, I’ll buy you a pony with
the first load of corn I sell.” He looked at his pretty
wife’s glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes, and thought
with a groan that he was tied by his principles and
prevented by them and the public opinion of the Community
from giving his wife this enjoyment. It was
the first time that his heart had come into conflict
with the perfect theories of Perfection City, and he
was amazed and disturbed to find how very much he
was vexed by them. Fortunately Olive dismissed the
idea of a pony of her own as an unattainable bliss,
and contented herself with chance rides on Rebel
and Queen Katherine, the two horses which inhabited
Ezra’s stable and were generally used by him on his
side of the community-land.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive’s courage and spirit of independence, fostered
by a very mild-tempered horse, grew apace. She soon
felt able to dispense with the escort and instruction
of Willette and go cattle-hunting alone. She learned
quickly enough to know the sixty head of cattle belonging
to the Community, and where to look for
them. The cattle, which consisted of the usual mixture
of milch cows, steers, yearlings, and calves, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>been bought at different times and were apportioned
to the different families in rough division, chiefly because
each woman liked to have the cows she was to
milk, driven up to her own fence near to her own
house to save trouble. The cattle, consequently,
seemed to have become intensely individualistic in
their tendencies, and absolutely refused to graze in
common. Each bell-cow led off her own herd of steers
and yearlings where she thought best on the prairie,
and it was seldom that any two of those “leading
ladies” chose to go to the same spot. If they did
they generally quarrelled and fought a bit. Cattle-hunting,
therefore, became a sufficiently diversified occupation
in which the unexpected frequently occurred.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day it happened that Olive and Diana, now
old enough to run with her on her expeditions, had
been to the head of Little Cotton Wood Creek to look
for a cow that had hidden away her calf there, after
the manner of prairie cows. Olive found the truant
and the “little stranger,” along with half a dozen
young cattle, and was driving them slowly homewards,
when she became convinced from Rebel’s demonstrations
that something was annoying him under the flap
of his saddle. In fact he was constantly trying to bite
Olive’s leg in a way which agitated her not a little. Accordingly
she resolved to take off the saddle and make
an inspection. She dismounted, undid the girths, and
lifted off the heavy Mexican saddle. Rebel, who had
always hitherto regarded this proceeding as indicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>immediate liberty, no sooner felt the saddle removed
than he took a base advantage of Olive, and
kicking up his heels bounded away from her. She
set the saddle in the grass and walked pacifically after
Rebel, held out a deceitful hand and called him endearing
names. Rebel listened to her honeyed words with
his ears flat on his neck, and as soon as she came near,
again kicked up his heels and bounded off.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diana considering all this a joke in which a puppy
might lend valuable assistance, now pranced forward
with energetic barks, and the cows and calves deeming
themselves to be driven with fierceness, set up a
lumbering trot across the prairie, the new-made mother
every now and then diving ineffectually after Diana
with a plunge and a snort. A stampede had set in
among the animals, and Olive sat down and cried
with vexation and alarm. Her home showed clear
and distinct against the horizon just four miles in a
bee-line from where she sat shedding her ineffectual
tears. Now Diana, although a feminine creature and
also a puppy, and therefore endowed with a double
dose of original foolishness, was likewise a dog, and
consequently amenable to the highest inspirations of
a noble nature. Having therefore in her character of
puppy worried and distracted the animals to her
heart’s content, she suddenly felt bound to exhibit
some of the better sides of her nature, among which
remains forever pre-eminent fidelity to the master.
Seeing that Olive was not in the scrimmage, Diana
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>turned her back resolutely upon the delights of snapping
at calves’ heels, and putting her nose to the
ground raced straight back to Olive weeping in the
grass. After an apologetic wriggle Diana sat down
and looked at Olive. Now no philosopher or other
mortal has ever succeeded in being as wise as a tired
puppy can look. Therefore when Olive in spite of
her woe caught sight of Diana’s face and attitude, she
burst into a laugh in the midst of her tears, whereupon
the latter sprang merrily up and licked her face. Thus
comforted, Olive arose, and then became aware that
she didn’t know where the saddle was. She had neglected
to mark its position in any way when going
on that deceitful embassy to Rebel, but indeed it would
not have been easy to mark the position of the saddle.
The grass was in its greatest summer height, and there
was neither bush nor tree anywhere for miles around.
There was not even a hillock or knoll of ground to
give individuality to one spot more than another, all
was the relentless rolling prairie—a vast grassy sea
where one billow was exactly like a hundred others.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was in dismay. Here was a fresh cause for
tribulation, for the saddle was new and expensive,
and moreover it belonged to the Community. She
would not have minded facing Ezra with a tale of any
sort of disaster or loss, for she knew he would kiss
her and pet her and say, “Never mind, darling, don’t
grieve, it doesn’t matter two jack-straws.” But a community-saddle
was quite another matter, and Olive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>shrank from the ordeal of community-anger at the
loss of its saddle, and community-contempt for her
carelessness in unsaddling on the prairie without putting
the reins over her arm. She perceived now that
anyone but a fool would have taken that simple precaution
against disaster. “I’m not fit to live on the
prairie,” sobbed Olive to herself. “My education is
no use to me, and I have not got the wits of that boy-girl
Willette. Diana, you idiot, why don’t you help
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>This reproach was addressed to the puppy, who
was wallowing blissfully in the grass and thus refreshing
herself after her scamper. Olive began to walk
aimlessly up and down in the hope of stumbling on
the saddle, and Diana began to do likewise, but with
far more system. Diana’s researches were speedily
crowned with success, and she soon sat down to an uninterrupted
gnaw at the flap of the big Mexican saddle.
Becoming at length aware of the disappearance of
Diana, Olive called to her, and the puppy reared a
mischievous face over the grass some twenty yards
away. Going to the spot, Olive perceived the saddle
and also the depredations of Diana’s sharp teeth upon
the flap. She whipped the dog with a stirrup leather
most ineffectually and then said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s to be done now?” but Diana, feeling that
her efforts had been badly rewarded, made no suggestions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Indeed Olive’s plight after finding the saddle was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>considerably worse than before. The thing was very
heavy. Mexican saddles are built on wood, large,
strong and ponderous, and weigh heavier and heavier
in proportion to the distance one carries them. Olive
put it on her shoulders and began to see stars, she
then tried her head and found that position still worse.
She dragged it along by a stirrup-leather and found
she was ruining it. Then she sat down and cried,
which was the most useless effort she had made. What
was she to do? If she were to leave the saddle and
walk home she would never be able to find it again.
There was absolutely nothing to mark the spot. By
this time the cattle were distant specks moving solemnly
homewards, with Rebel decorously following in
the rear. Olive decided to remain where she was until
Rebel and the cattle, by their arrival without her,
should have given the alarm, which would bring Ezra
and the rest of the Community to the rescue, somewhere
about the middle of the night, she supposed.
It would be humiliating, but she thought it would be
better than abandoning the saddle which she could not
possibly carry. She sat down to wait with what patience
she could for rescue and humiliation. There
was nothing to expect along that weary stretch of
grassy sea, and yet Olive kept looking and looking
away to the north, east, south, and west. By and by
she beheld a horseman coming up from the distant
west and holding a slanting course which would carry
him past Perfection City some mile or so to the north.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>She resolved to intercept this man and ask his aid, so
she stood up and signalled wildly with her hat. Of
course he saw her instantly, although he was a couple
of miles away, and equally of course he at once turned
his horse towards her and set off at a gallop. People
on the prairie ask and give help freely, and Olive
had not the slightest hesitation in calling this unknown
horseman up to her aid, although she had not
the remotest idea who he might be. Probably he was
a cattle-hunter like herself, at any rate a man and a
horse would be able to give her and her saddle effectual
assistance. The man galloped steadily on and soon
took the ordinary appearance: big hat, red shirt, riding
boots, belt with probably a revolver somewhere in it.
He slowed up a little as he came near and seemed to
be very intently looking at Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very sorry to have troubled you,” began
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t mention it. I shall be delighted if I can
be of use,” said the man, taking off his big hat.</p>

<p class='c010'>They both stopped short and looked hard at each
other, for their speech had mutually revealed the fact
that they were a lady and a gentleman, a most uncommon
encounter on the Kansas prairie beyond the
last bit of cultivated land.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you had an accident? Are you hurt?”
asked the man, jumping off his horse and mechanically
slinging the bridle-rein over his left arm, as Olive
noted with some self-reproach. She told him what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>had happened, and she saw a smile creep round his
mouth and light up his blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is easily remedied. I feared you must have
been thrown,” said he. “Just mount my horse. He’s
quiet. I’ll take you home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the saddle,” said Olive looking very anxiously
at that burden.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! that’s nothing,” said the stranger. “I’ll
carry it on my arm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must not dream of such a thing. I could
not think of allowing it. You are very kind, I am
sure, but if you would take up the saddle in front
of you that is all I want. The saddle is the only difficulty.
I can walk quite well. I live in that house
over there on the brow of the bluff. It is not far, but
I could not carry that terrible saddle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, that’s Perfection City, where the Communists
live,” said he, looking at her curiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I live there,” replied Olive with a slight
blush, noting the look.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And are you a communist, if I may presume to
ask the question?” queried the stranger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My husband was one of the founders of the—the—of
Perfection City,” said Olive, valiantly determined
to defend the absent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you are not one of the original members.
You are surely a new-comer. I know most of them,
by sight at all events.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am Mrs. Weston,” replied Olive with dignity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The stranger again took off his hat, as if this were
an introduction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have seen your husband then, a magnificent
specimen of manhood, to judge from the only example
I had of his physical strength.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive felt at once mollified. Meanwhile, the
stranger had shortened the stirrup-leathers of his
horse, and turning to Olive he said,</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now, Mrs. Weston, allow me to give you
a hand up to mount you on my big horse. He is quite
gentle and I will hold the bridle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive hesitated. “I don’t like to take your horse,”
she said. “If you would be so kind as to leave the
saddle——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, you must not deprive me of the pleasure
of your company,” interposed the stranger. “We
will manage the saddle all right. Just spring up.
Your riding-habit is admirably adapted for prairie
life, and the prettiest I ever saw. Pardon my bluntness,
but I am so little used to society, I fear I am
very rough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t fear anything of the sort,” replied
Olive quickly. “You are perfectly aware that your
manners are infinitely superior to the article in general
use hereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man laughed pleasantly at this sally. “Well,
let me amend my pleading,” said he, “and say, it
is so long since I met a lady in these wilds, and that
is true enough, Heaven knows!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Olive mounted the big horse with the dextrous
help of his hand and signed to him to give her the
saddle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I couldn’t think of it,” said he, thrusting his arm
under the saddle and hoisting it on to his shoulder.
“It would be unspeakably uncomfortable for you
to hold, with the stirrups whacking you at every
step.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you shall put it on the horse’s neck in
front of me, or I’ll hop down this instant. It’s bad
enough to appropriate your horse without making you
carry my saddle as well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Seeing her so determined, he, with a slight show
of reluctance, placed the saddle on the neck of his
horse, who after a shake or two submitted to the burden,
and so they eventually turned homewards.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose you are not surprised that we settlers
out here take considerable interest in your experiment
in communism,” remarked the man as they
walked along.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt anything out of the common excites
comment,” said Olive guardedly, “but I should not
have thought you could be classed as a settler out
here. I have seen a good many, and know the type.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She felt interested in the man and curious to know
who he was, he seemed so utterly different from all
those she had hitherto met.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have lived here, nevertheless, for some years
now. I have a farm on the north side of Big Cotton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Wood Creek. My name is Cotterell. Have you ever
heard it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I never heard the name, but then I’ve only
been here a very short time, only two months. I—that
is, we came in May,” said Olive blushing somewhat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stranger smiled a winning smile and looked
up at her face as he answered,</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see you have only just come, and come as a
bride to Perfection City. It has a very suitable sound
in that connection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He again lifted his hat, and Olive blushed more
vividly still.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The prairie does not seem a very hopeful place
for experiments in perfection,” continued the stranger.
“To my eyes it looks a most God-forsaken place, but
under certain circumstances I should be disposed to
modify that view.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think any place will do to try and live a good
life in, and that is what is aimed at in our little Community,”
said Olive, standing bravely to her defence.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was silent for a time and then spoke again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any place can be made better by the presence
of a good woman, I think.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We want to show how it is possible to banish
some of the evil out of life,” said Olive, marshalling
the expressions she had heard at the Academy with
what skill she could.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With some it is only necessary to be what God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>made them in order to banish evil from their presence,”
said he.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And we have a very noble woman as leader,”
said Olive not quite sure of his meaning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, indeed! You praise her, that should count
for much. There are very mixed reports about her
character on the prairie. Many seem to dislike and
distrust her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As for that I suppose there are mixed reports
about us all,” observed Olive impartially.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed there are. For instance, it is most
confusing what people say concerning the extent
to which you carry your communistic theories.
Some assert that there is no limit and that you are
logical.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t understand what you mean,” said Olive,
knitting her brows.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I presume now that the land is held in common?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, certainly, and the farm implements and the
horses and cows,” answered Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All those don’t really touch the question. You
live in separate houses, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course we do. I should hate not having my
own little house. It would be like a hotel or a penitentiary
for all to live under one roof. I wouldn’t do
it for worlds. We have our home-life just like other
people, but I should like to have a pony of my
own, only I suppose my husband would not think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>it right to have a horse that was not a community-horse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a confounded shame! I beg your pardon.
You see I am rough. I mean, I think your
husband ought to get you a pony, a nice well-trained
lady’s pony, for you to ride, and not a big farm-horse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like one,” observed Olive simply, and
then suddenly remembering that she was speaking to
a stranger, she added hastily, “I mean it would be
nice to have a horse always at hand, one not liable to
be wanted for farm work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I just happen to know of an excellent animal
that would suit you down to the ground. It belongs
to Tom Mills, and he wants to sell it. It will go cheap
too. If you would speak to your husband about it,
I would bring it over for you to look at. Mills lives
close to my house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, pray don’t,” said Olive anxiously. “I am
ever so much obliged to you, but I really ought not
to have spoken about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well,” said he, seeing she was distressed,
“we’ll not pursue the subject further.” But in his
own mind he reflected that were he in Weston’s place,
he would have got that pony for his wife, principles
or no principles, and it is highly probable that he
would have done so.</p>

<p class='c010'>He left Olive and her saddle at her own door,
refusing her invitation to enter, saying that he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>avail himself of her permission to come some
other day to see her. And she cordially invited him
to do so, for was not hospitality one of the commonest
virtues of the prairie, and surely Perfection
City must not be behindhand in the practice
thereof?</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>When Olive got home, she was at first pleased to
see that her husband had not come in, therefore he
had not been made uneasy about her absence. Napoleon
Pompey had caught Rebel and turned him into
the pasture field, and was returning after that job when
he met Olive near the hen-house. Napoleon Pompey
grinned at her and remarked with relish: “Ole hoss,
he done throw yer, den run clar ’way home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, he didn’t,” retorted Olive, indignant at this
slur upon her equestrian skill, “I just got off to
change the saddle, and he ran away from me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Land!” said Napoleon Pompey, “an’ didn’t yer
chuck yer reins roun’ yer arm?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I forgot to,” confessed Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Golly Ned!” said Napoleon Pompey with vast
amusement.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive felt annoyed and inquired stiffly where her
husband was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ole man he done gone ter git ole hoe men’d
up, den he gwine ter go to der ’Sumbly, he done eat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>supper ’ready. Me an’ you’uns got ter eat our’n now.
Ole man done tol’ me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Napoleon Pompey meant no disrespect in speaking
of Ezra as “ole man,” for the lad knew of only two
titles to bestow on white men, one was “Mas’r” the
other was “ole man.” Ezra had requested him not to
use the expression Mas’r, which grated on his ears,
and contained suggestions of servitude at variance with
the ideas that prevailed at Perfection City. Napoleon
Pompey was therefore obliged to fall back upon his
one other title. Olive had been greatly shocked when
she first heard her husband called “ole man,” but she
was now used to the expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was very disappointed not to see Ezra at once,
for she was full of her adventure, but she knew from
experience she must possess her soul in patience, for
the “’Sumbly,” as Napoleon Pompey called it, was
sure to take a good while, and Ezra always stayed
conscientiously to the last. The institution was none
other than the bi-weekly Assembly, which met at the
Academy, and at which all the business of the Community
was settled and the routine work of the farm
arranged for. All the members were free to attend
and speak their minds, but in practice it had resolved
itself into a Junta of Madame, Ezra, Wright, Green, and
Uncle David, of whom the two latter were sleeping
members. The women of Perfection City did not care
to attend the Assembly very often. Women are not
good debaters, and they dislike arguments carried on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>under strict rule. They prefer to go their own way,
do what seems best at the moment, and reserve an unlimited
right of grumbling and jealousy. Madame, who
was an exception to the general rule, usually presided
at the Assembly and ruled it, as she did most things,
without seeming to do so. Ezra and Brother Wright
understood the farm work and generally mapped out
the daily labour pretty well. Brother Dummy required
only to be told what to do and went on contentedly
doing it, without comment or commotion.
Nobody, of course, was ordered to work, but it was
suggested that if Brother Wright would do so and
so, Brother Ezra would be able to do this, that, or
the other, while Brother Carpenter would be free to
perform such another task, and Brother Dummy would
probably prefer to work at whatever happened to be
wanted at the moment. Madame seldom interfered,
and then only when necessary to smooth over a rough
edge. She usually found the men’s arrangements
excellent and for the general weal. Brother Green,
who was a first-rate smith, was the only member of
the Community who, at this time, received any money,
for he worked in his spare time for outsiders. With
great pride he used to bring the money he earned to
the ’Sumbly and give it into Madame’s charge to be
expended as seemed best. She kept the accounts and
used to furnish all the rest of the necessary cash.
Sometimes the brethren expressed compunction at calling
so often on her resources, but Madame always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>made the most graceful speeches in reply to their objections.
Of course an undertaking such as this required
capital to start it. It would be foolish to starve
the whole project for want of a little expenditure
now. By and by they would be self-supporting, but in
order to reach that stage quickly they must not be
stingy now. So she gave her dollars by the hundred
when needed, and the brethren were eternally grateful
and privately wondered if there was any limit to
her wealth and generosity. At the Assembly it would
be debated whether the next load of timber that was
bought should go to building a hen-house for Brother
Carpenter or to putting up a cattle-shed for Brother
Ezra, and it speaks well for the honest conviction of
the Pioneers that it was usually Brother Ezra who
argued in favour of the hen-house, while Brother Carpenter
expressed an anxious desire for the cattle-shed.
The difficulty would perhaps be settled by Madame
desiring to know how much timber was required
for both buildings and deciding to buy that amount
at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this particular Assembly to which we refer,
Ezra was several times on the point of saying that
he wished to get a pony for his wife, but his
heart failed him. He knew he did want the pony
very much, but he also knew that it was not
really wanted for the Community. So he could not
bring himself to give utterance to the individualistic
wish, and after arranging the necessary business of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the Community, he came home with his wish unstated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was waiting for him with the greatest impatience.
She went, indeed, as far as the bars to meet
him, but the road looked so lonesome and the sky so
black with cold trembling specks of stars, that she
ran back again in a flutter of panic to the house and
shut herself in with the candles for company. At last
he came back, and Olive poured forth the pent-up
torrent of her news. Ezra was much amused at her
description of the disaster and interested in her account
of the rescuer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I am so vexed,” said Olive, “I can’t for the
life of me remember what he said his name was. I
know I never heard it before, but he lives here on the
prairie. It is so silly!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Call him Perseus,” said Ezra laughing, “he was
the gallant who came to the rescue of distressed damsels.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a good joke!” said Olive gleefully, “and
I was a distressed damsel, I assure you. I cried with
vexation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have no doubt that Andromeda shed tears when
she was bound to the rock,” said Ezra, amused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I was bound to that odious saddle by the
bonds of duty,” said Olive. “What a joke! Mr. Perseus!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So they laughed and chatted, and Olive was as
bright as possible, and Ezra thought again with a pang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>of that pony and almost wished he had spoken at the
Assembly about it. Olive, however, never mentioned
what Mr. Perseus had said about the pony Mills had
for sale. The idea seemed to have passed from her
mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>It happened that about a week later Olive again
found herself in the neighbourhood of Little Cotton
Wood Creek, and by an extraordinary coincidence Mr.
Perseus chanced to meet her. She was very much
surprised, and he seemed to be no less so. However,
the meeting was mutually pleasant, and they soon fell
into conversation, as it appeared he was going her
way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have thought a great deal about what you said
to me the other day, about trying to make life better
and all that,” said he with a certain self-consciousness,
as if he was unaccustomed to speaking upon such
a subject. Olive looked at him with bright clear
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very glad if anything I said could be of
use to you, but I am myself very ignorant. I should
like you to come and hear what Brother Wright says,
and Ezra. Brother Wright is considered very eloquent.
I can’t always understand him myself, but
that is my own deficiency!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would much prefer talking with you, Mrs.
Weston,” said the stranger hastily. “I am very restive
under men’s teaching, but I am docile enough
when led by a woman’s gentle hand.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“Why are you living here?” asked Olive suddenly.
“You seem so unsuited to this life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sick of civilization and all its horrors,” said
he. “I wanted to get away to something fresh and
new.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is almost like what a Pioneer would say,”
remarked Olive with a smile. “They don’t think
very highly of what civilization has done so far.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Materially it has done much, morally it has done
badly for a good number of human beings,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you sound like a very hopeful convert
to the principles of communism. Why don’t you come
to Perfection City?” asked Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you be glad to see me there, Mrs. Weston?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, Mr. Perseus, and I should be so pleased
to make you and my husband known to each other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked at her curiously for some moments and
then said, “Why do you call me Mr. Perseus?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive gave him one horrified glance and then
blushed scarlet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” she stammered in great
confusion. “I did not know I said so. I really am
most sorry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why that name?” he persisted, still looking
at her blushing face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I may as well tell you the truth,” she said still
much confused. “The fact is I forgot what you said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>your name was, and my husband suggested in a joke
that I should call you Perseus, because—because——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I rescued you in distress,” said he as he broke
into a deep musical laugh. “It is a capital name, I
am delighted with it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so ashamed of myself,” said Olive, also
laughing, “but I was in the habit of speaking of
you as Mr. Perseus, and the name slipped off my
tongue unawares. What is your real name? Pray
tell me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not for worlds, dear Mrs. Weston. To you I
shall remain Mr. Perseus, and I shall never think
of the name without a thrill of pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But this is most unfair,” said Olive. “You know
my name and who I am and all about me, and yet
I am to be kept in the dark as to your identity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forgive my not doing at once what you wish,
but really I cannot. This will be a sweet little innocent
romance to me, and before you I shall appear in
my very best light, leaving all the vices and evils of
my real nature behind me for the time. Ah no! don’t
deprive me of such a harmless joy. If you knew what
a lonely uncared for life is mine, your tender heart
would be touched.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her heart was touched by the quiver in his deep
voice, as he intended it should be, and Olive did not
press her point any further. They rode on together
talking about a hundred subjects, and she found him
the most agreeable of men. She happened to mention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>a great novel just then coming out in Harper’s,
the scene of which was laid in Florence, and he said
musingly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah yes! Florence is a lovely city, nestling among
the blue hills.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you ever seen it then?” asked Olive much
surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, long ago, when I was a young fellow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She gazed at him. “You are a most incomprehensible
person,” she said, “living here on this prairie
and yet you have seen Florence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You forget Perseus travels easily with his winged
feet, from here to Florence would be a bagatelle to
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I begin to think there must be something uncanny
about you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now don’t go and change me into any other personality.
Remember you are all-powerful, and by your
word alone have made me Perseus. Your word is
mighty, and you can cast me down into hell and make
me a devil by a breath,” said he half banteringly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What odd language!” said Olive, looking a little
frightened. “How you must astonish the natives
when you talk in that way!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you fancy I talk to anyone as I do to you?
Don’t you understand that I am Perseus to you, but
to nobody else in the world?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive laughed, and put her horse to a canter in
order to snap the thread of talk which was becoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>too difficult for her. Mr. Perseus remained in her
company while she was driving home the cattle, but
they had no further particular conversation, as the exigencies
of driving the herd occupied their attention
most of the time. On parting from her about a mile
from her home, he promised to come some day to see
her, and Olive added, “I do hope Ezra will be in, for
I should so like you two to talk together. I am sure
you have much in common.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have one point in common, at all events,”
thought Mr. Perseus as he rode away back towards
the Big Cotton Wood Creek, “but I doubt very much
if that would at all add to the harmony of our relations.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was full of her meeting with Mr. Perseus,
an account of which she retailed to Ezra at supper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And just fancy his oddity! He wouldn’t tell me
his real name after my unlucky slip, so he is Mr. Perseus
to the end of the chapter, I suppose. He thought
it such a joke.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So he saw the application,” remarked Ezra.
“He must be a man of education.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a most superior man, I can see that. He
has read everything I ever did and more too. And
do you know, Ezra, I shouldn’t wonder if he had leanings
towards community-life, many things he said
pointed that way. Wouldn’t it be funny if I were
to be the one to bring in your first convert, poor little
me that never had any leanings until I saw you.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Ezra looked sharply at his wife during this speech,
for a sudden and by no means pleasant suspicion
sprang into his mind concerning the mysterious Mr.
Perseus. However, Olive looked so perfectly innocent
of even all knowledge of evil that he felt ashamed of
himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t be too friendly with this man. We
don’t know anything about him, nor who he is, remember,”
remarked Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He said he knew you and that you were a fine-looking
man, you old dear, and he is acquainted with
most of the members of the Community by sight.
Besides, I thought it was a point of etiquette on the
prairie to make no inquiries into a person’s character,
but to take him in his boots just as he stands, and ask
him to dinner. Don’t you remember Charlie Clarke,
and how he came to supper by your invitation and
you found him so pleasant, and he a horse-thief and a
murderer all the while, only we didn’t know it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was all very true, but Charlie Clarke had
evinced no “leanings” to community-life, and above
all Olive had been profoundly uninterested in him and
was delighted when he left. Ezra hated himself for
the feeling in his heart, but he had his suspicions of
Mr. Perseus, and he knew his wife was distractingly
pretty. So he advised her to keep aloof from Mr.
Perseus as much as practicable. Several times afterwards
he made excuses to go riding with her, which
Olive enjoyed immensely, but then something was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>said to her about his shirking his share of the work,
and she was furiously angry. She wanted her husband
to be first, and since the only theatre for the exhibition
of his abilities was the somewhat restricted one
of Perfection City, she wanted him to be always near
the front.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shirking indeed!” she said tossing her pretty
head. “I’ll have Mary Winkle know my husband
never shirked in his life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In a blaze of wrath she met Ezra and ordered him
to go to work and never mind riding with her till
the harvest was over. She wouldn’t ride any more,
she would work until she was black in the face. Shirking
indeed! She’d let Mary Winkle see! And so on
and so forth, till her burst of anger had spent itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was not slow to perceive that her husband
had some sort of dislike to the idea of her seeing Mr.
Perseus. She could not exactly explain to herself
why this should be, and she was heartily sorry for it.
She had fancied that in time Mr. Perseus might possibly
come to be a member of the Community. She would
indeed have been frankly glad to have him become a
brother, for, as far as she could judge, he seemed a
man of brilliant parts, and certainly his manners were
most charming. To tell the truth, she found the
members as a whole very uninteresting. Mary Winkle
she positively disliked, and yet she was the one nearest
to her own age. She sometimes wondered how
Ezra could be satisfied with the companionship of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>those same people, who seemed to her to be walking
in such a narrow circle, and always to be saying the
same things in pretty nearly the same words. Now,
Mr. Perseus said such original things and in such a
charming voice. Altogether it was a pity that Ezra
should have taken a prejudice into his head against
this stranger. Olive wondered whether, if they met,
the mutual recognition of their abilities would dissipate
her husband’s suspicions. Such being her notions,
it was most unlucky that the first time Mr.
Perseus came to see them Ezra should have been gone
to Union Mills. He went so very seldom that it was
a most unfortunate coincidence, as she explained to
Mr. Perseus, who did not in return explain that having
himself seen Ezra at Union Mills he had straightway
ridden off to visit her, and ridden so hard too that
his horse was in a white lather when he arrived at
Perfection City by a somewhat circuitous route. Napoleon
Pompey was gone, so Olive showed him where
to put his horse in the dark stable so that the flies
would not torment the animal. She remarked on the
horse’s state and asked Mr. Perseus had he been running
down cattle, and he muttered something about
young horses showing every bit of work in hot weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was profoundly interested in Olive’s little home.
She showed him with pride the garden she had made,
where already the balsams were just coming into blossom;
she then took him to see the prairie chickens
she was trying to rear, little black and yellow downy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>things, with fierce wild eyes utterly untamed and
only looking out for a favourable opportunity to make
a dash for freedom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think I can ever tame them?” asked
Olive, as she noted the hostile manner in which they
scuttled away from her food-giving hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If anyone could tame them you could, the ungrateful
little brutes!” remarked Mr. Perseus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see that it is ungrateful of them to resent
being taken from their proper home and natural mother
to be put under a fat stupid hen,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, but it is rank ingratitude not to be tame to
you,” said he.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think you are truthful,” said Olive
bluntly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?” asked Mr. Perseus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because you are always saying things like that,”
she answered, somewhat resentfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I do call that hard,” complained Mr. Perseus,
“to charge a fellow with being untruthful when
he was shaking in his shoes from terror at having perhaps
let out too much of the truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive looked down at his big boots, knitting her
brows, and then led the way into the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll get you some dinner. I am sure you are
hungry,” she said hospitably, it being about two o’clock
in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am hungry, starving, mind, body, and soul,”
said her visitor in reply.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“I’ll get a chicken-pie for you, that will go some
way,” answered Olive with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And if you will talk with me, that will go far
to complete the work of charity,” said he.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive brought him the food, and he set to work
upon it, being evidently, as he said, very hungry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know I am beginning to look upon Perfection
City as a sort of earthly paradise,” said Mr.
Perseus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, a paradise from which I am shut out. Have
you any young men here, Mrs. Weston, unmarried
men, or are they against your rules?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. Unmarried men are not against our rules,”
said Olive archly. “We had one here lately, but we
haven’t now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, what did you do with him?” asked Mr.
Perseus, in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I married him,” said Olive dimpling and blushing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lucky beggar!” remarked her visitor, turning
again to his dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Perseus stayed some time, but refused Olive’s
invitation to wait to see her husband, saying as an
excuse that he had a long way to ride home. Olive
wanted to know where he lived, but he laughingly
put her off. He would not tell her, lest she should
discover his real name, and then much of the romance
of his life would be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“You don’t know what this is to me, and how
when I am leading my lonely life, I recall every word
and look and again go through these meetings, Mrs.
Weston. I suppose it seems silly to you, but remember,
human companionship is man’s most precious
inheritance, and those who have but little of it prize
what they have at perhaps an extravagant figure. Did
you ever hear of Silvio Pellico?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” replied Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, he was a prisoner entirely shut off from
human companionship, and he at last made friends
with a spider, and at length the spider was crushed
by the turnkey’s foot, and Silvio wept tears of anguish.
I am like a prisoner out here on this desolate
prairie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And am I like the horrible spider, then?” said
Olive brightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Weston!” he exclaimed reproachfully. “I
have opened my heart to you because I felt that you
could feel with me, although the world might count
us as strangers, but I thought you would understand
what I meant even when I blundered through the expression
of my thoughts. This is the first time you
have misunderstood me. But I believe it was only
pretended misunderstanding and that you do know
what I meant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He said good-bye, and left Olive with a feeling of
sadness and oppression on her mind. He had not been
as bright as before, and she wondered who he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>and why he was so anxious not to see anyone but her.
She mentioned his visit to Ezra, but somehow she
had less to tell about him than on former occasions.
There seemed nothing to say. Ezra, too, did not appear
as much amused as formerly at the joke of Mr.
Perseus. No doubt it was getting stale by this time.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>FIRST LESSONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Summer came on apace. The field had been duly
run over in both directions with the shovel-plough,
so as to leave between the cross-ploughing little “hills”
of earth, out of which sprang the corn-clumps. The
broad green ribbons of leaves fluttered in the wind,
making a soft murmur as of a forest. Olive took great
delight in her little flower-garden at the east end of
the house, and worked and weeded at it both early and
late. Napoleon Pompey, typical negro boy, which
being interpreted means laziest of mortals, forgot his
laziness to work for “Mis’ Ollie” as he called her.
Together they had planted their balsams, trained their
morning-glory, and rooted out brown beetles with zeal,
to be amply repaid in July by a glorious profusion of
blossoms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is my very ownest own garden,” said Olive,
exhibiting her balsams with pride to Ezra. “Mind,
this is not community-land, it’s mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does it make you enjoy the flowers more to think
that nobody else has them?” asked Ezra, with a tinge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of sadness in his voice. “Would it make you any the
happier to keep the sunshine all to yourself, do you
think?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, certainly not, that’s quite different. But I’ve
planted these flowers and grown them. I shall give
them to whomsoever I like. You for instance.” She
smiled coaxingly at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You pretty child,” he said, disarmed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I brought some over to Mrs. Carpenter
to-day. I went to help her with her washing. And,
do you know!” said Olive, “I was so amused.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Carpenter was educating his children.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s always doing that,” said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but to-day there was a special lesson. He
was at Union Mills yesterday, and he got a present
for both of them, I mean two presents, one for Johnny
and one for Nelly. You know he is always saying
boys and girls would have the same tastes if they were
brought up in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’ll find out one day, maybe, that boys will be
boys, no matter how you bring them up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has found it out already. Wait till you hear.
By way of correcting any early bias, he gave a hammer
and nails to Nelly and a doll to Johnny.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t say so! What did the children do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, they went off without a word, each carrying
its toy, and Mr. Carpenter told me his ideas about
education, and how well they worked. Suddenly we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>heard shrieks from behind the wood-pile where the
children were playing. We ran out to see what was
the matter. Nelly had got a handkerchief tied over
the head of her hammer, and she was cuddling it to
sleep in her arms. Johnny had got some of the nails
and was trying to drive them into a piece of wood with
the head of the doll for hammer. Nelly was screaming
because he was killing poor Dolly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra laughed, and Olive joined in at the recollection
of the scene. “You cannot think how disappointed
Mr. Carpenter looked. His wife said he’d
got something to do if he was expecting to cure little
girls of dolls in a hurry. We changed the presents and
left him to reconcile it with his theories as best he
could; both children were quite happy and contented
afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor Carpenter! He’ll have to learn by bitter
experience that he cannot change human nature all
at once,” said Ezra, sympathetically. “I fear children
are still in the savage stage of development, they are
not communists.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nobody is communist about things they care very
much about,” said Olive, in desperate courage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Ollie! What a thing to say! I am a thorough-going
communist I hope. I’d give the coat off
my back without a pang.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course you would, because it is a horrid old
thing any way, and men look frights in coats always.
Men don’t care about clothes, only just to cover themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and keep themselves warm. One rag would do
as well as another.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are an incorrigible little individualist and
a greedy one as well, I do declare,” said Ezra, half
laughing at her vehemence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it’s not that, only I see what is what,” replied
Olive oracularly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what might that be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Pioneers are only communistic for rubbish
and rags, and not for dolls and hammers. That’s what
they are,” said Olive, with her face aflame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rubbish and rags! What an absurd thing to
say. Who ever heard such nonsense?” said Ezra,
loftily ignoring his wife’s argument in a way that wise
men often affect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Tisn’t nonsense,” said Olive hotly. “It is just
what people say of Perfection City.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What people say it?” asked Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Mr. Perseus for one,” said Olive, repenting
of her daring in getting into the subject at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Perseus,” repeated Ezra with a sudden frown,
“so you talk over our principles with him. When did
you do so last?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know exactly when. The other day. He
often passes by here on his way cattle-hunting. Sometimes
he looks in for a moment, but sometimes he can’t
stay long, only to water his horse. Of course I talk
over the principles that have made you found a City
here. Don’t you suppose people know about them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and talk them over eagerly? They are different enough
from the generality of people’s ideas, and Mr. Perseus
said they considered you only went a little way into
communism, and had a little bit of this and a little
bit of that in common, and weren’t at all logical.
People sneer at Perfection City, I can assure you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you, doubtless, enjoyed his sneers,” retorted
Ezra injudiciously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I didn’t, only I saw what other people say
of us. Mr. Perseus, even, once said he’d like to
come and be a communist himself, if we were only
consistent throughout, and lived up to our principles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may tell your friend Perseus that he would
not be a welcome recruit,” said Ezra, in considerable
agitation. “I may as well tell you now what I have
suspected for some time. I know pretty well who
your mysterious Mr. Perseus is. He is a man of the
name of Cotterell. I know him very well by sight
and better still by reputation. To convince you, I will
just mention a point or two about his appearance. He
is about five feet ten in height, very fair in complexion,
with a yellow moustache, and bright blue eyes, and
whenever he takes his hat off you see the blue veins
very markedly on his temples. He is, I suppose, what
a woman would call a very handsome man, and he
usually rides a black horse with a blaze on his face
and white hind feet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, that’s the man,” said Olive who remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the horse well, and who moreover recognized the perfect
accuracy of her husband’s description.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well. Now I will tell you something about
his character and history. He is an Englishman and
perhaps has been badly brought up. At all events he
hasn’t the morals we approve of. I know his libertine
London ways. He probably didn’t tell you about it,
but I remember very well the poor girl who shot
herself the first summer we came here, because Cotterell
had abandoned her. If the neighbours had been
quite sure of all the facts of the case, there would in
all probability have been a shooting party at Cotterell’s
house, so I was told. But they were not quite sure
so they gave him the benefit of the doubt. Accordingly
he still has his handsome face to go on with and
maybe wreck more homes. That is the career of Mr.
Cotterell, alias Mr. Perseus,” said Ezra with considerable
heat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was you who gave him the name of Perseus,”
replied Olive also much agitated. “He did not appear
under a false name of his own accord. And now that
you tell me his real name I remember that was the
one he gave the first time I saw him, and he asked
me if I had ever heard it before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t say anything on that point, it may have
been a joke on his part, but it must stop now. Understand
me, Olive. I don’t wish to seem harsh, but
you must not meet and talk with this man again.
If you chance on him, pass by and say you can have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>no further communication with him. If he urges an
objection, say I have forbidden you to see him, as
I do forbid you, here and now. He will take that
for an answer, scoundrel as he is, for among people of
his stamp personal vanity does duty for better feelings.
He won’t come again to a house where the lady
has once shown him the door. You don’t in the least
understand what his motives are in this new-fangled
interest of his in Perfection City, but I understand
them very clearly, and my wish is that you never see
him again. Harm is sure to come of it if you do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was very much alarmed at her husband’s
stern manner and peremptory order, but she was also
indignant. Mr. Perseus or Cotterell, as she must now
call him, had shown great respect and deference to
her and had evinced a desire to be guided by her to
higher aspirations. She was not sure of the meaning
of some of his remarks, or rather she wished she could
find some other reasonable explanation for them than
the one most people would undoubtedly attach to them.
Still she resented her husband’s masterful manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will of course obey your orders, Ezra,” she
said with a tart emphasis on the word which made
him wince, “because I hold old-fashioned ideas of
what wifely duty is, quite at variance with the high
standard of individual liberty as maintained and explained,
I believe, by the brethren of Perfection City.
You may rest quite satisfied, I will obey you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Having thus stabbed her husband in his most vulnerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>point and dexterously driven the poignard up
to the hilt in the wound, Olive walked away, leaving
Ezra to feel himself a selfish brute.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra spent a wretched half day of self-reproach,
and then crept back repentant, begging to be forgiven
for being a tyrant to his poor little pet. And
his little pet who had paid for her pride with abundant
tears, allowed him to kiss her and fondle her and call
her sweet silly names, while she declared she never
cared to see or speak to that wretched Mr. Cotterell
again, and no wonder he was ashamed of his own
name, etc., etc., all in the most foolish and approved
manner possible to the newly married.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the same, after a time Olive began to feel sorry
for Mr. Cotterell, and to pity him for the very errors
of his past life, about which she now saw that he was
penitent without wishing to explain to her why. Also
she had very much enjoyed meeting him; he was so
fresh, cultivated, and original, in his conversation. It
was really very dull sometimes with no one to talk to,
and the long hot day shimmering by, making her feel
as if she were a potato being slowly baked in a hotair
oven. There was no excitement in the house-work
and—and it was very dreary sometimes. Men delight
in reverting to primitive savagery. The most highly
civilized man “reverts” in a way which is surprising
both for completeness and for rapidity, but women
hate the process. Savage woman was a slave, and the
more completely a woman becomes subject to primitive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>conditions the more closely she resembles a slave, and
is in virtual bondage either to some human being or
to hampering circumstances.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of appropriate companions of her own sex Olive
had absolutely none. Mary Winkle was a rigid reformer,
a person all angles, of the sort that never becomes
a companion to anyone, for she was always on
the war-path, and, besides, between her and Olive there
was an unexpressed, but no less real, antipathy. Her
daughter, Willette, that creature half boy, half girl,
and wholly wild, was always on horseback careering
after stray cattle, and though by her ignorance and
eccentricity she sometimes amused Olive, she had really
no ideas beyond those very concrete ones impressed
upon her from without by her open-air life on the
prairie. Mrs. Carpenter was a good soul, but a mere
stout housewife, with no ideas and only one hope,
namely, “that Carpenter would give up his high-fallutin’
notions, an’ go back to York State, an’ settle
down comfortable again, an’ be a preacher in a Baptist
church.” Mrs. Ruby was old in body, but the youngest
of them all in mind, except Uncle David, who was
her senior by four years. Mrs. Ruby believed in Perfection
City, though she reserved the right of private
judgment on certain of the tenets of its founders, and
in particular, she had lately felt misgivings as to the
worldly wisdom of their principle of non-resistance.
She knew, however, that the Pioneers were going to
show the world the new and better way—the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>which led into no competition for supremacy, but into
peaceful paths of universal progress. Property and
its attendant imps, greed, strife, jealousy, envy, hatred,
and malice, were all banished from Perfection City,
and in their place peace and good-will and perfect trust
in each other were to reign forever. It was a high
ideal, but not a new one. It was eighteen centuries
old, though it had never yet been realised. Mrs. Ruby
and Uncle David felt sure they had reached the ideal,
and all through Madame Morozoff-Smith, the most
whole-souled, unselfish, glorious woman of her century.
It was a pity she had not a larger theatre in
which to present before mankind the new principles of
social life it was their privilege to put into practice.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>A day or two after Ezra had laid his commands
upon his wife, as we saw in the last chapter, he came
home in the evening to find her in floods of tears.
Her eyelids were all red with weeping, and she broke
out afresh on seeing him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter?” asked Ezra, in much concern.
“What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My poor flowers, my pretty balsams!” sobbed
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has the calf got into your garden and spoiled
your flowers, my poor child?” he said tenderly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it wasn’t the calf, but they are all gone.
Mary Winkle took them all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” said Ezra with a slight shock of surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, she has cleared the whole garden. She
came to-day while I was out at Mrs. Huntley’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know it is she who has taken them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Napoleon Pompey told me he saw her pick
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Depend upon it, he is lying,” said Ezra with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>emphasis. “Negroes are as mischievous as monkeys,
and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, he didn’t do anything to the flowers,” interrupted
Olive. “He was as pleased with them almost
as I was myself, and worked ever so hard to help
keep down the weeds. Besides, I went to Mary Winkle
and saw them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” said Ezra helplessly. He wished it had
been the calf or Napoleon Pompey or anybody or anything
rather than Mary Winkle. He braced himself
for what was coming.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She told me she did it with a purpose. She
said I was getting more individualistic in my leanings
every day, and that time was not curing me at all,
that I was selfishly proud of my flowers. It isn’t one
bit true,” sobbed Olive, with quivering chin. “I gave
heaps of them away. I gathered a bunch for Mrs.
Huntley just as I was going this morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra groaned. “I know you did, dear,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She said I gloated over them and rejoiced because
nobody else had any. I didn’t. I only loved
them because I had tended them and reared them, and
I knew them and watched for their buds. She said
they didn’t belong to me, but to the Community, and
that she took them on behalf of the general weal.
Those are all grand words for nasty mean jealousy and
covetousness,” said Olive passionately. “I hate Mary
Winkle and I hate the Community.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Olive, Olive!” cried Ezra with a gesture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>entreaty. “Don’t say that, dear. It strikes me to
the heart. Think of me, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My pretty flowers!” she said with a drooping
of her mouth that betokened fresh tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so sorry, oh, more sorry than I can say,”
said Ezra. “Mary Winkle has done wrong, and has
administered a lesson in a cruel, brutal way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She has no business to give me lessons at all,
and I won’t take them from her,” cried Olive passionately.
“I hate being the one to be always taught.
They think themselves so superior and are always
stooping to raise me. Let them raise themselves first.
I can see where Mary Winkle needs teaching and correction
as plainly as anybody. She is only communistic
in regard to things she doesn’t really care about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no Ollie, darling. It is really a deep conviction
with us all, although in this case most unkindly
illustrated,” said Ezra gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know you think so in all honesty, but it isn’t
so in reality. Nobody is nor can be communistic about
what they love, if it is real love. If they are communistic
about a thing it is because they don’t really
care.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra knew by the pang of jealousy in his own
heart that this was an insurmountable truth his little
wife was hurling forth in her anger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mary Winkle isn’t communistic. I’m not clever
and able to say wise things and use long words that
amaze people like Brother Wright, but for all that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>can see some things clearly enough. Mary Winkle
isn’t any more communistic than I am, only we love
different things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you mistake,” said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t mistake one bit. Let Mary Winkle,
if she is communistic in all the moods and tenses,
lump her child with the two little Carpenters and draw
lots to take one of the three for her own. Would that
satisfy her heart, although the precious principles
would be right enough? Of course not, because her
heart would step in and claim its own by the divine
right of love. I should be thoroughly communistic
on the score of these children. I shouldn’t mind to
draw lots as to whether Willette or Nelly or Johnny
Carpenter was going to come to live with me. One
would do as well as another, and I could be thoroughly
communistic, because I don’t love any of them
very deeply. My little flowers I did love. It wasn’t
that I had worked for them and grudged the fruit of
my labour. I would work in a turnip field and let
anyone who liked have the turnips, nasty, watery,
pulpy things, but I loved those flowers and tended them
and they were mine. I don’t care about the philosophy
of the question. You will perhaps some day see
what I mean, Ezra, and understand me. I know you
don’t now. You think me a silly child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In his own heart he thought he understood more
clearly than he liked to confess, that Olive was speaking
more than philosophy, she was announcing stubborn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>facts. However, he strove his utmost to soothe
her feelings, for he could see that if an attitude of
strife and hostility were once set up between her and
Mary Winkle, it would not only affect his wife’s happiness
but might have very serious results upon the
future of Perfection City. There were only a very
few of them, and if the experiment was to succeed it
could only do so through unity, while strife and internal
dissensions would certainly destroy it without
giving it a chance. This point was fruitful of deep
meditation, and occasioned heart-searchings to Ezra.
It indeed augured ill for the future, not only of Perfection
City, but of all those other cities of their imagination
which should spring from this mother plant,
if the personal feelings of a couple of good women
were potent enough to wreck the scheme. Surely, in
the dozen or so choice spirits who now formed the
entire population of that City, there could be none
of those latent forces making for destruction which
would have to be reckoned with in the future and
larger experiments in communism they were leading
up to. If it was so difficult to soothe ruffled feelings
in Perfection City now, and to compose a quarrel about
some wretched little balsams, what would happen
when, in a larger Perfection City, deeper cause of dispute
arose between numbers of persons? Ezra’s mind
recoiled aghast at the answer which rose up in his
mind in reply to that question. There would have
to be some strong, some overwhelming central power,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a despot in short. Was this then the goal which they
were to reach after toiling along a hard and stony
road of personal effort? A despotism or a monasticism,
in either case tyranny and subjection. Surely, oh
surely, there must be some other solution which his
mind, disturbed by the sight of his little wife’s distress,
had unaccountably failed to formulate. He
would go to Madame and would seek guidance from
her illumined mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive, spent by her emotions, had gone to sleep
quite early, so Ezra sallied forth to seek counsel where
he was used to find it. Madame would be sure to be
still up—though it was late by prairie hours, after
nine o’clock—as he knew by experience, for in his
bachelor days he had often spent long evenings in discussion
and talk with her. Since his marriage, however,
he had never gone alone in the evening to talk
with Madame. Happy in his own love, he had felt
no need of other companionship, and now as he walked
along to her house, he began to wonder if she had
noticed the sudden cessation of the evening talks, and
also to wonder if she had missed them. It was thoughtless
never to have gone near her during all these
weeks. It was selfish, seeing how kind, how always
sympathetic she had been to him for so many months,
during the time when he felt lonely and full of undefined
longings, before his heart had found complete
rest in Olive’s love and above all in his love for her.
Ezra thinking of these things was smitten with remorse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and made a resolution to go and see Madame
of an evening sometimes and to bring Olive with him.
Meantime he walked along and in a few moments
knocked at the familiar door. Madame opened it herself,
with Balthasar in close attendance. The latter,
on satisfying himself that it was a person of friendly
intentions who claimed admittance, walked back to
the spot where he had been lying, and resumed the
thread of his interrupted slumbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brother Ezra, this is indeed a most unexpected
visit. I hope it is not because there is anything wrong
in your little home,” said Madame gravely.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra felt much embarrassed. He could hardly say
there was nothing the matter, and still less could he
apologise for having forgotten during all these happy
weeks to come to see her. He did the best thing
under the circumstances. He ignored Madame’s remark
and question, and plunged boldly into the business
which had brought him.</p>

<p class='c010'>She listened gravely without making any observation,
but occasionally the faintest shadow of a smile
fluttered around her lips. Ezra watched her face somewhat
anxiously. In the old days, he had been used to
read her face when they talked together, and to catch
the meaning of her words from the mobile and everchanging
expression of her clear blue eyes. But to-day,
somehow, as he looked, he felt he had lost the
power to read. The face was now a mask which seemed
to conceal the real woman underneath, and yet it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the same fair smooth brow, the same sharply defined
eyebrows, and, beneath, the same eyes. No, the eyes
were not the same. They no longer looked clear and
full at Ezra, but were often averted in a strange and
uncertain manner, as if seeking to hide or to flee. At
least such was the curious impression they produced
upon him, as he sat looking at her and telling of the
mighty wave of wrath that had surged up about that
handful of balsam blossoms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a most singular cause of division, and one
I could almost laugh at, except for the very real passions
of anger and of hatred it has aroused,” he said
in conclusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One often sees terrible bursts of anger and
fury in immature minds,” observed Madame in
the preamble of her answer. “Young children
and people of weak intellect frequently exhibit
the most pitiable extremes of fury over trifling
causes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra was not quite certain to what she referred.
If to Olive, then she was mistaken in considering her
a child. He recalled very vividly what she had said
about communism in what one loves, and he was not
at all prepared to admit that her arguments were those
of a person of weak intellect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think this is a case for ‘criticism-cure’
in the Assembly, do you?” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, certainly not,” replied Ezra, who was keenly
alive to the possibility of his wife’s blazing up into uncompromising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>criticism herself, if they attempted to
apply the famous “cure” upon her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Criticism-cure” existed rather in theory than in
practice in Perfection City, but it was held that if a
brother or a sister should be guilty of any offence
against the common weal, it would be an edifying
experience to summon him or her to the Assembly,
and let all the members tell him or her exactly what
each one thought of the conduct in question. In
theory this was supposed to work admirably, and to
be a weapon capable of reducing to reason the most
refractory member of the Community, but when Ezra
remembered it and imagined for a moment its possible
effects on Olive, he foresaw a whole train of deplorable
results. Suppose she defended herself, she could
say sharp rankling things with a surprising amount
of unanswerable truth in them, or suppose she didn’t
defend herself, but took the scolding silently. Her
eyes would get bigger and bigger with tears which
would roll over her cheeks, and her sweet little chin
would quiver, and she would look imploringly at him.
He couldn’t stand that, he knew, but would rush up
and take her in his arms, and carry her off out from
the midst of the carping, criticising brethren, and he
would call her sweet pet and darling, and say she was
right and they were horrid brutes to scold her, and
he would be very angry and would be quite capable
of knocking Brother Wright down, if he, as was likely,
had been savage with the little pet. No, criticism-cure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>should not be applied to Olive. And Ezra, arguing
thence into wider fields, began to feel some doubts as
to the value of that remarkable weapon as a means
of eradicating the naturally evil tendencies of the human
heart. Theories which had seemed sound and
complete in the abstract had a curious habit of ringing
false when he imagined himself as applying them
to Olive. It was very curious, but they did not seem
to fit her, or was it possible that the theories themselves
were wrong? No, he dismissed that thought as
entailing too much mental demolition and carting away
of rubbish. Of one thing only was he sure, the “criticism-cure”
was not to be tried on his little wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think it is a case for petting rather than for
punishing,” remarked Madame, after an interval during
which they had both been severally following out
the ramifications of their own reflections.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra jumped at this idea. He was of that opinion
too, as he impartially observed. Indeed he was always
of opinion that Olive required petting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I think I understand the case,” continued
Madame. “The flowers were a toy, doubly prized now
they are gone. What is wanted is to provide a new
and more attractive toy, so that the baby-mind will
lightly forget the old grief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra did not quite like this way of referring to
Olive, but he had called in Madame’s aid, and he had
no choice but to listen to the physician’s diagnosis
and prescription regarding the case in question. Madame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>meanwhile looked at him half pityingly, having
apparently overcome her eyes’ desire to avoid his
glance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor Ezra!” she said softly. “You are mated
to a child, petulant, wilful, hard to manage, and very
bewitching. You will find that you cannot in this
case work by the light of pure reason. You must
bring yourself down to her level and try to see with
her eyes, to take delight in the petty trifles that interest
her. ’Tis weary work! The task of Sisyphus was none
the less severe because it produced no tangible good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She was silent, and Ezra began to repent that he
had sought counsel from so exalted a source, since it
was delivered to him with such a liberal seasoning of
the bitter salt of implied reproof.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that I can apply a remedy in this instance,”
resumed Madame. “I know a woman’s mind
as well as most people, and I know too the vain weaknesses
of a silly girl—perhaps the knowledge comes
from a memory, or perhaps from a shattered hope,
who knows? At all events, dear friend and brother,
it will serve you now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She left him to go into the small inner apartment
which was her bedroom, and came out again in a few
moments carrying a small gold bracelet of curious
workmanship, an Oriental trinket.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here is a little trifle I happen to have by me.
Do you think this toy would dry the little one’s
tears?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>She handed the bracelet to Ezra, who, though ignorant
enough on such matters, did not fail to recognise
the flash of diamonds in the jewel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is a very valuable piece of jewellery,” he
said. “You must not give it away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t value such things except for the power
of making someone happy,” replied Madame. “Take
it, dear friend, and think that I speak truly when I
say I would gladly give all I possess to ease your mind
of trouble and make your path in life a pleasant one.
And the child-wife may like it. Now, go to her. Good-night!
You look tired and harassed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She gently put her hand upon his forehead as if
to smooth out wrinkles, and left the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Ezra walked home with the diamond bracelet
in his pocket, he seemed to feel her cool soft touch
still, and the thought came into his mind that Olive
never petted him. No, it was he who always petted
her. Well, she was very sweet and pretty, and he
hoped the bracelet would comfort her.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no doubt about that. Olive danced
for joy when she saw the trinket. She put it on her
smooth little wrist and flashed it about in the sunshine.
Her eyes rivalled the diamonds for brightness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you like it, Ollie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like it! Why, it’s too lovely for anything, and
Madame is just a darling, and she is kind. Just fancy
giving me a diamond bracelet! A thing I never dreamt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of ever owning. And how shall I ever thank
her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was skipping with joy. Suddenly she stopped
short.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ezra, is this mine, or is it a community-bracelet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is yours, child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mary Winkle can’t come and take it away for the
good of my soul, can she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, certainly not. We are allowed to hold
private property in such personal trifles, as you
know quite well. Besides, Sister Mary would
not wish to take from you what you particularly
prized.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, of that I am not at all so sure. If your
principles allowed it, I would not give much for Sister
Mary’s self-restraint in the matter. She might want
the bracelet for herself or for Willette, for what I
know. I shall tell her the bracelet is mine even by
community-law.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive began to skip again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are an intractable little mortal, for all you
look so soft and yielding,” said Ezra. He could not
help smiling at her pretty kittenish ways, but he was
filled with a sort of amazement to perceive how impossible
it was to change the trend of her mind. Had
she been an angular woman, all bones, like Mary Winkle,
it would not have seemed so strange. Olive
brought her frollicking to a conclusion and looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>wisely at her husband, shaking her pretty little head
at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, Ezra. It is not that, but you are trying
to stuff me into a wrong-shaped mould, and I don’t
fit. As if any mortal woman ever could care for a
community-bracelet!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She danced away to put her treasure in some safe
place, and Ezra went off to his work, wondering in
his own mind if there was something radically antagonistic
to communism in the female nature. If there
was any such fundamental incompatibility of temperament,
then farewell to all ideas of a successful issue
to their experiment. Absolute equality between men
and women in position, power, and influence was the
key-note of their theories, but what would become of
these theories if it should appear that the female mind
refused to accept the first and greatest postulate upon
which they were all founded?</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>A CHANCE MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The spring whence the Westons drew their water
was about a quarter of a mile from the house across
an angle of the corn field. A little foot-path winding
in and out among the hills of corn led to it. As
the corn grew, this path changed in character and became
at length a track through a miniature forest.
The corn grew to about eight feet in height, and of
course the first to be covered was little Olive, with her
brief five feet two inches, but by the end of July it
had covered them all. Then it became Olive’s greatest
delight to go down through that forest where the
corn shook in the breeze. The satin-smooth stalks
coming up like bamboos, and the broad fibrous ribbons
of leaves, were a constant pleasure. But greatest
joy of all was to watch the coming of the silk.
When the young ears of grain were forming they
threw off great skeins of exquisite silken threads,
changing through every tint from palest green to rich
dark crimson. These bunches of silk were like soft
plumes falling from the crest of the husk that held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the ears, and were most tempting to twist through
idle fingers. A forest of tall-growing prairie corn
is just the place for fairies, only alas! the wee folk
had departed this life long before ever Olive went
to live at Perfection City. So charmed was she with
this dwarf forest, which afforded the only shade to be
enjoyed on that glaring prairie, that during the summer
she always went to the spring for an extra pail
of fresh water every afternoon before supper-time,
as this errand gave her an excuse for loitering among
the corn stalks and amusing herself with her own
playful fancies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diana of course accompanied her young mistress
upon these walks to the spring, for the puppy was
attached to her by bonds of firmest canine affection,
while Olive, on her side, was never tired of laughing
at Diana’s ridiculous freaks, although they sometimes
caused her considerable trouble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take an example.</p>

<p class='c010'>A day so hot and scorching that words fail to convey
any idea of it, and Olive in a great fuss, for she
was behindhand with her work. At four o’clock, the
very most blistering hour of the whole twenty-four,
she set off hastily for the spring to fetch the fresh
water, and with her Diana, her tongue lolling out
half a hand’s breath. Knowing the object of the expedition,
the puppy took the path through the corn,
and Olive sweltered after her. It seemed as if the
shelter of the corn was powerless against the slanting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>shafts of sunlight that danced and chequered between
the broad hanging leaves, while the very air seemed
endowed with such a load of heat as to press down
with more than the allotted weight upon Olive’s head.
She climbed over the fence and walked across the
grass to where the spring started from under a tiny
overhanging ledge of limestone rock. It was an excellent
spring with the best of water, and would have
been made into the holiest of wells by a spreading
tree or a shady thorn-bush near it. There was, however,
nothing of this sort, but only a clear pool of
water some two feet across and about a foot deep,
just enough, in fact, to enable one to get a good dip
with the bucket. As Olive, hot and tired, hurried to
this little pool of water, she beheld the accomplished
Diana sitting in the middle of it, cooling herself and
slobbering water up and down over her nose in supreme
bliss. Poor Olive! She did not know whether
to laugh or to cry, but eventually decided upon the
first-named course. Then she sat down beside Diana
and paddled her feet in the water, after which refreshment
she returned home with her water-pail empty.
The spring had an undisturbed night in which to
renew its freshness, and in the future Olive kept her
eye on Diana when they went together for water.
The dog always wanted to go first, but Olive kept her
severely to heel until the water was obtained, after
which Diana was free to indulge in what diversions
she pleased.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>One day as Olive emerged from the pathway
through the corn, her heart gave a great bound of
alarm as she saw a man standing beside the spring,
holding his horse’s bridle. He was a tall man in a
red shirt and large-brimmed hat. He carried a revolver
at his belt, but it was not that which frightened
Olive, she was well accustomed to seeing armed men.
On catching sight of her the stranger took off his hat
with a sweeping bow, and coming forward greeted her
with the greatest eagerness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is indeed a delightful meeting, Mrs. Weston.
Quite idyllic, if I may say so. And are you coming
to fetch water? It is a subject for a poem, only I
am not a poet. I can feel all the beauty of it, but
must be dumb. You’ll let me carry back your pail
for you, won’t you? It is too heavy for those wee
hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, Mr. Cotterell. I can quite easily
carry my pail. I do it every day,” said Olive speaking
with much embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Cotterell!” he repeated with infinite sadness
in manner, and with a look of much meaning in his
bold blue eyes. “You call me Mr. Cotterell, then I
am no longer Mr. Perseus, and my sweet romance is
shattered forever!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know now that you are Mr. Cotterell,” said
Olive, in keen distress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And knowing that, you are disillusioned and have
lost faith in me, and you will not even let me carry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>your pail of water for you,” said he, sadly, in a way
which cut Olive to the heart, “yet I am the same man
I was. To you at least I have never changed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know you are very kind,” said Olive, “but if
you please I’d rather you didn’t carry the pail for
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She was dreadfully sorry to say anything to hurt
his feelings, but she remembered her promise, and
she must make him understand here and now that
their acquaintance was to cease. She wanted to do
it as kindly as she could, but she must do it at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cotterell was not slow to read her thoughts, indeed
her distress was too real and undisguised for him
to fail to understand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this an order of dismissal, Mrs. Weston? Am
I not to come to see you any more?” he asked abruptly,
with a look of pain in his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive glancing up saw the pain and felt sorrier
than ever, but she went bravely forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am deeply pained, Mr. Cotterell, but I must
ask you not to come to see me; my husband does not
want you to,” she said, unable in her distress to find
any words which would convey her meaning unmistakably,
and yet not sound too unkind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your husband has forbidden you to see me?”
said Cotterell, biting his yellow moustache savagely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Olive simply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your husband’s sentiments would do credit to
a dog in the manger, Mrs. Weston, but are not what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>one exactly looks for from a professing communist,
who poses as a shining light for his poor fellow-creatures
still groping in the darkness of their ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He says you are a bad man, Mr. Cotterell,”
said Olive with a view to defending her husband and
perhaps finding out the facts of the case about her
mysterious friend, in whose personality she felt a great
interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t pretend to be a good man, Heaven knows!
but I’m a poor lonely devil living quite by myself, and
your husband, with all that the world can give in
the way of happiness, grudges me the brief pleasure
of talking for half an hour with a good woman. That’s
not the way to make me a better man, Mrs. Weston,
and God knows I need all the help I can get.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m so sorry,” faltered Olive in ready sympathy,
and the tears welled up into her tender black eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You sweet pitying angel,” said Mr. Cotterell,
coming nearer and speaking very gently. “Your influence
would save me if anything could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you mustn’t talk like that,” said Olive, with
a catch in her voice. “And you will be a good man,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He bent his handsome face low, and taking her
hand implanted a kiss upon it with a grace that might
have charmed a duchess.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A woman can make or mar a man’s life,” said
he. “Happy are they who draw the prizes. Goodbye!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>He sprang upon his horse and galloped away.
Olive stood watching him, her eyes swimming in tears,
she scarcely knew why, only he seemed so sad and
so handsome. Ezra was unkind to say she must
never see him any more and try to make his life
less sad and wicked, and she was so sorry to
think that she would never have any more talks
with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment a low growl from Diana made
Olive turn round to encounter the clear cool gaze of
Madame Morozoff-Smith.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I followed you down here,” she said. “Napoleon
Pompey told me that you were most likely gone to
the spring.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you been here long?” asked Olive, blushing
in her surprise and confusion. “I only came for
a pail of fresh water.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I just saw Mr. Cotterell say good-bye and
ride off,” observed Madame gently. “Do you see him
often? He hasn’t a good reputation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe he is as bad as people say, I am
very sorry for him living alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He need not have been alone only that he chose
it, indeed it ought to have been quite otherwise, if
report goes true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We ought to be the last persons on earth to
credit reports,” said Olive hotly. “I am sure there
is a nice crop of them about us and our life here at
Perfection City, if it comes to that.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“True, I daresay there are,” said Madame. “One
should be charitable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was evidently ill at ease, and Madame drawing
from a totally different experience of life her own
conclusions, became convinced that Ezra’s wife was
carrying on a secret acquaintanceship with a man of
whom he thought very ill.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame’s position as leader at Perfection City
gave her many rights and imposed certain duties. She
considered that of private admonition as one of them.
She did not speak for some moments, and the two
walked along in silence. Madame was debating in her
own mind whether she should speak to Olive and endeavour
to turn her from the dangerous path towards
which she seemed to be directing her steps; or whether
she should keep silence and let her destiny be accomplished.
She reflected that if she spoke to Olive,
that rather high-spirited young woman would probably
resent her interference, and might possibly complain
to Ezra, with the result of estranging him from
herself. On the other hand, if she left the silly wife
to go her foolish way, she would break her husband’s
heart. Madame’s well-shaped lips curled with a smile
of contempt for herself as these thoughts passed rapidly
through her brain. What a fool she was to stir
in the matter! Let the giddy girl follow her own impulses
and then—No, no! She would be true to her
best self, she would put forth a hand and draw back
the blind fool from the precipice that lay before her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>She spoke therefore to Olive in that soft quiet
voice of hers that seemed to have more power of arresting
the attention and holding it than the roar of
an avalanche.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you are, perhaps, not acquainted with
Mr. Cotterell’s character,” said she. “I am sure you
would not wish to associate with a bad man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you think he is a bad man? Do you
know him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t know him, but I am sure I am right
in saying that he is a man of loose morals,” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe it,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not? How can you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I have talked with him a great deal,
and he speaks like a man with high aspirations, and
not at all like the bad man you say he is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what can you know of a man’s real character
from a chance word or two as you run across
him in an afternoon’s stroll?” observed Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t judge from a chance word, I have had
long talks with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed! and where? Do you meet him here at
the spring then, so often?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never met him at the spring before, but I used
to meet him pretty often, when I was out cattle-hunting
and he would generally accompany me for a bit.
Sometimes too, he used to pass our house on his way
cattle-hunting, and then he would look in and water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>his horse and stop to talk to me for a time,” said Olive
in explanation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really!” said Madame looking keenly at her
companion, “and did Ezra know of these visits?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ezra said he wasn’t to come any more, and I
told Mr. Cotterell so to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! and what did he say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He called Ezra a dog in the manger, and I do
think Ezra oughtn’t to be so harsh about Mr. Cotterell.
He would like to be a better man, I know, if he
had any chance, and people were kind to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he intimate that you could influence him
towards the better way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see why I can’t try to use my influence
in trying to make my fellow-creatures happier and
better. You and Ezra are always talking about
doing good that way. Why do you want to stop
me the moment I see a chance of doing a little
good?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because you would only do harm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I shouldn’t. A woman has great influence
over a man. He said so himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Cotterell said so?” inquired Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a very dangerous thing for a young woman
to attempt to influence men of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t know what sort he is, nor anything
about him. You are only following reports. And
how can you talk about the danger of influencing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>men? That is just what you are always doing yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With me it is quite different,” said Madame
hastily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is what everybody says to me whenever
I want to do what other people find it right to do. I
hate being treated like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very young and very pretty, child, and
that makes it all the more necessary for your friends
to guard you against dangers which you don’t perceive
as clearly as they do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hate being young and—well—pretty, if it’s always
going to make me be treated like that,” said
Olive angrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like a naughty child. That’s what Ezra does,
and he goes to you to ask what he should do to me,
you know he does.” She was beginning to cry, just
like a naughty child.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame smiled contemptuously as she glanced at
her companion. “What could have possessed that
quiet reserved Ezra to marry such a feather-headed
vain little puss?” she thought bitterly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive dried her eyes angrily, she saw the contempt
expressed by Madame’s curling lips, and her pride
was thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to know why things are different as soon
as they apply to me?” she asked with doubtful grammar
but unmistakable import. “It isn’t this once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>only, but it is always so. Personal liberty is the corner-stone
of Perfection City, that is what you are
here for, to enjoy liberty and protest against things.
Mary Winkle won’t take her husband’s name, and
dresses like a fright, and nobody minds. She’s free.
But as soon as I try a little flight of my own, that
doesn’t hurt anybody, I’m to be popped into a cage,
and you and Ezra come and shut the door on me.
I met this man by chance and liked talking to him.
He is well-mannered and well educated, and likes the
same books as I do, and has travelled and could tell
me heaps and heaps of interesting things. He wasn’t
forever talking in the same little muddling circle, and
wasn’t always full of himself. He tried to interest
me. You are an educated woman, Madame, and you
know as well as I do that, except for you and Ezra,
there is not an educated person in Perfection City,
nor one who has the same tastes as I have. Mr. Cotterell
used to come and talk to me, and I liked it;
then Ezra gets very angry, says he is a bad man, and
forbids my seeing him. He forbids me, mind you.
Not a bit the sort of language you would expect in
Perfection City, but I believe in wifely obedience and
I obeyed him. I told Mr. Cotterell he must not come
to see me any more, and he won’t do so. He always
showed the best spirit in everything he said, and I
won’t believe he is so very wicked just on mere report.
We once had a horse-thief and murderer to stay
to supper, and we did not inquire into his character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>before we asked him to stop and rest and feed his
horse. Mr. Cotterell said my influence might help
him to be a better man, and perhaps it might. At
all events, I want to know why I wasn’t to try to influence
him, and I want to know why Perfection City
ideas, when they make for freedom, are not applicable
to me, but have to be all turned upside down when
I come into play? Can you, Madame, answer me
that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame was considerably dumbfoundered by this
attack delivered so unexpectedly and so very straight
from the shoulder. She hastily recast her idea that
Olive was a silly little fool, and most unaccountably
found herself anxiously seeking about for means of defence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fact of the matter is, you are too pretty to
do these things,” she replied, helplessly telling the
truth in her extremity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can Perfection City then only succeed if all the
women are ugly?” asked Olive scornfully. “You had
better not proclaim that fact, or you’ll have all the
women running away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame was in the habit of being worshipped by
men, and was not at all prepared to have her remarks
ridiculed by a slip of a girl. She did not like it, and
therefore replied with some asperity,</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are really too silly, Sister Olive. You must
surely perceive that there is great danger in your
associating with Mr. Cotterell on so familiar a footing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>that, in short, he may fall in love with you, and I
presume you can understand the danger of that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Precisely, a fresh set of laws must, as usual, be
applied to me, and not those which govern the rest
of you,” said Olive calmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t understand to what you refer,” said Madame
looking at her doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Cotterell knew from the outset that I was
a married woman. I don’t see the alarmingness of
the danger that he might fall in love with me, simply
because we talked together. The idea has only struck
you in reference to me; it does not seem to have done
so with regard to the similar circumstances of you and
Ezra.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame turned white with anger. “How dare
you insult me by such an insinuation?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t dare until after you had first given utterance
to the insinuation against me,” replied Olive,
with provoking calmness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame turned as if she could have struck her,
but she controlled herself with a desperate effort.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me, Sister Olive, that your remarks
are very ill-judged,” she said in a voice that shook
in spite of her. “I have no wish to bandy words
with you. I spoke merely out of a desire to do my
duty, and to save you, if possible, from a danger
which I imagined I foresaw more clearly than you
did. I see that your words were prompted by quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>another wish than to seek advice or counsel in a difficult
moment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I sought for neither advice or counsel,” returned
Olive. “I simply wanted to discover, if possible, how
to fit the theories of Perfection City, which I know
pretty well by heart now, into the practice as applied
to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame looked at her with eyes of anger and even
of hate, and Olive, conscious of having been almost
more successful than she had imagined possible in
argument with so distinguished a mind, returned the
look with one suggestive of triumph. Alas for the
perfect harmony of Perfection City!</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am surprised, I will not say pained, because
you would care little for that, but I am surprised, I
repeat, at such words in the mouth of Ezra Weston’s
wife. He must have been strangely mistaken in your
character, or you cannot have revealed your true self
to him, for I cannot imagine him binding himself for
life to a mate who scorns and flouts in this manner
what he holds so dear. You are mocking the principles
to which he has devoted his life. You are too
foolish to see what you are doing, but one day you
will be punished, and then perhaps you will repent—when
it will be too late.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame turned and walked rapidly away, leaving
Olive feeling very angry and very much frightened
as well.</p>

<p class='c010'>That evening Napoleon Pompey carried a note
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and a small parcel to Madame, who guessed pretty well
what it was. The note was brief, it contained but
these words:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you sent the bracelet as a present,
therefore I accepted it and was grateful: now I know
you sent it as a reproof, therefore I return it.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PRAIRIE FIRE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The summer had been a particularly dry one, and
since the beginning of July not a drop of rain had
fallen. The water-melons revelled in the heat, and
Olive revelled in the water-melons: for by a blessed
compensation of Nature the hotter and drier the land,
the cooler and juicier the water-melons seem to be.
The water-melon of the western prairie is as different
from the pallid green-fleshed vegetable which masquerades
under its name in this country, as the full moon
of the heavens is superior to the lime-light article
manufactured for use on the stage. The real prairie
water-melon is an enormous affair, being about as large
as the roll of rugs without which fussy gentlemen
consider it impossible to travel. The skin is of the
darkest green and as hard as a board, a most unripe-looking
object at all times. Indeed the only way one
can find out the condition of a water-melon’s insides
is by surgical operation. You simply cut out a plug
about an inch square from the top side of the melon,
and look to see if the flesh has turned crimson at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>centre. If it is still white or pale pink you know the
psychological moment, when the truly wise will eat
the melon, has not yet arrived. Accordingly you put
back the plug, and leave the sun to work a little longer
on it, at a temperature of a hundred and twenty or
so. Since it never rains at the melon season of the
year, the plug does not do any harm if left on the top
side, but the beginner sometimes leaves it on the
lower side, with the result that all the water runs away.
It is a curious fact, but the water of a melon, even
of one picked in the middle of a scorching hot day,
never seems tepid. It is always cool and refreshing,
even at times when ordinary water tastes unutterably
mawkish owing to the excessive heat. The crimson
spongy flesh, specked with purple-black seeds, is eaten
in moderation or in immoderation according to the
taste of the individual, but the water is always greedily
drunk up by everybody. The scorching winds of the
plains seem to dry one’s very marrow, and nothing can
exceed the thirst of a man who is obliged to be out all
day in such weather and to work hard at the same time.
Animals, too, suffer from extreme thirst, and after a
morning’s ploughing when the farm horses are brought
up to water, they drink and drink and drink, swelling
visibly under one’s eye, as if they were india-rubber
horses under the action of some new patent inflator.
They are never stinted in their drink and swallow
bucketsful before attacking their corn.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to return to our water-melons.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Napoleon Pompey used to bring up a wheelbarrow
full from the melon patch each morning for
the day’s consumption. He, like a true negro, was
inordinately fond of melons, or “millions” as he
called them, and would have sucked them all day long
if left to his own devices. Whenever he had to go
anywhere in the waggon, as occasionally happened,
he would lay in a store of “millions,” and lay himself
beside them, and suck them, just as if he were a black
caterpillar of unlimited capacity. The horses meantime,
far too oppressed with the heat to require much
attention, would plod along with their eyes shut, trying
to keep out the glaring light. There was nothing
to stumble over or fall into, so the driving became
of the most elementary pattern, requiring only an
occasional rattle of the reins and a comment or two,
such as: “Yo’, Reb, g’ ’long will yer, g’ out o’ dat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive during this period found the heat stifling,
and used to sit out of doors on the shady side of the
house, until the terrible wind blew up from the Plains,
when she would flee as before the breath of a volcano,
and shutting herself tight up in her room with closed
doors and windows, would gasp through the visitation
as best she might. She was no worse off than anyone
else, and the nights were always cool and refreshing.
That was an unspeakable blessing. All this heat dried
up the thick prairie grass until it was like a vast plain
of dry hay standing erect.</p>

<p class='c010'>The corn crop at Perfection City had turned out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>exceptionally good. There was ample for all the needs
of the Community and a good surplus which was to
be sold at Mapleton in order to enable them to buy
some farm-machinery that was greatly needed. Consequently
the whole Community worked hard at getting
in the corn so as to be early in the market. The
heavy ears of corn with their twenty rows of golden
yellow grains were stripped off the tall stalks by hand:
a most limb-lacerating job, for the “shucks,” or coverings
to the ear, are masses of fibrous leaves with sawlike
edges. These edges have the power of cutting an
exposed finger in a most painful manner, and they are
by no means loath to use the power.</p>

<p class='c010'>All this hurry and concentration of the workers
upon the cornfield was possible only if every other
sort of work was neglected for the moment. It seemed
the wisest plan to hasten off with their harvest in spite
of the risk, and, unused as they were to prairie life,
yet even they realized that there was some risk in thus
leaving their farms unprotected. Ezra was perfectly
aware of it, but like so many people he shut his eyes
and hoped for good luck. He spoke to Olive on the
subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If anyone so much as drops a lighted match on
the prairie we shall be lost,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, what do you mean?” asked his wife in
surprise. She was still so new to the prairie that she
did not understand to what he referred. They happened
to be on that outside landing of the stairs which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>looked out over the wide boundless western prairie.
This stairway from its position made an exceptionally
good place from which to take a survey of the whole
prospect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That grass is like tinder, and if anybody leaves
a coal of fire burning at his camping-place or drops
his pipe, the thing will catch in a second, and if there
is a strong west wind we shall see about as bad a prairie
fire as we care to.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, but that’s dreadful! What shall we do?”
said Olive, much alarmed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As soon as our corn is sold at Mapleton, we shall
plough all round Perfection City and back-fire, if we
can only get a calm day. We must not back-fire in
a high wind, because that would probably start a prairie
fire and just cause the very mischief we want to
guard against. It would take fifty people to keep a
line of fire under control for a mile’s length with grass
like that and a strong wind.” So spoke Ezra, critically
scanning the horizon for any sign of smoke which
might betoken danger. He was very uneasy, and the
fierce west wind, which seemed never weary of blowing,
made him all the more anxious, as it might prevent
them guarding themselves by running the usual
belt of burnt prairie all around Perfection City.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not a light job to get a safety belt of about
four miles long, for that was the circumference of the
portion of their land fenced in, and it was an impossible
one in the face of a high wind with their small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>force—unless indeed they did as selfish individualists
did, namely let the fire go and burn out whom it liked
and what it liked once they were themselves safe.
The Pioneers refused to be guilty of this act of treachery
to the common weal of the inhabitants of the prairie.
It is a comparatively easy thing to keep one line
of fire safe and so protect your own fields; the real
difficulty begins when you want to stop the fire from
spreading in other directions as well. Most of the
settlers back-fired their own land, and left Providence
or the Devil to see to the result as regards their neighbours.
The Pioneers had naturally a higher standard
of public duty than this, therefore they did not back-fire
in the high wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>The corn being stripped off the stalks, Olive’s
fairy forest was sadly mutilated, for the great ears
were all gone and many of the streaming leaves were
torn away; the walk to the spring, therefore, was no
longer so delightful as it had been earlier in the summer.
Still she and Diana used to go there pretty
often, especially since Napoleon Pompey was always
kept busy helping in the field. Coming up from the
spring one afternoon just before sun-down, she was
amazed to see her husband galloping madly along the
far side of the field on Queen Katherine, the big brown
mare, her harness banging her hot flanks at every
stride, while Napoleon Pompey on Rebel was tearing
after him waving his tattered old straw hat. Olive
for a moment or two stared in blank amazement at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>them, and then began to run towards the house which
appeared to be their destination also. Ezra and Napoleon
Pompey with frantic gestures seemed to invite
her attention to the setting sun, now sinking to rest
like a shimmering copper ball. She looked, but saw
nothing except the molten mass, unless it were a faint
blue haze on the horizon, the result, as she supposed,
of the intense heat.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Olive reached the house a few moments
later, it was to see her husband going hurriedly down
the road to the bars on the other side of the house.
The horses were hitched to the plough and were trotting
fast, while Napoleon Pompey was urging them on
with voice and whip. The plough, unaccustomed to
such speed, was jerking from side to side. A moment’s
halt at the bars, while Napoleon Pompey threw down
the rails, and Ezra turning round put both hands to
his mouth and shouted “Fire” in a long re-echoing
whoop. He wheeled around then and seizing his
plough-handles set off at a hand-gallop, bounding
along with his ungainly implement.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now Olive understood what that blue haze meant.
It was a prairie fire coming down on them from the
west along with a fierce wind. Oh dear! oh dear!
What should she do? There must be something women
could help at, in such a moment, if she only knew
what. But who to ask? Everybody was far away,
and the dreadful fire began to show up now that the
sun was no longer casting such bright rays.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Come ’long, git yer shingle,” shouted a familiar
voice behind her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Willette, is that you? What shall I do? It’s
a fire, and I don’t know what’s wanted.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothin’ but a shingle an’ a box o’ matches.
Quick now! We’ll hev ter pike, you bet. Pa and Ma
is out firin’ a’ready down yonder, ’side our house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so glad you’ve come,” said Olive hurrying
along with two wooden shingles under her arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shingles were merely the thin wooden “slates”
with which the houses were roofed. When thoroughly
dried they are admirably adapted for spreading a fire
from house to house in a street, and accordingly they
are now prohibited by law in most towns and cities.
On the prairie they were used in emergencies as paddles
to keep the back-firing within limits.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Ma said she ’lowed you wouldn’t know the
fust thing ter do,” remarked Willette complacently.
“An’ Pa said he reckoned school larnin’ in the East
could make folks more like nateral born fools than
anything under the sun.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was very little obliged to the Wright and
Winkle spouses for their opinion of her. She remained
therefore silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>They soon reached the furrows that were being
so desperately ploughed by Ezra and his foam-covered
horses. The swift twilight was almost upon them,
but they could see Wright urging his horses along
the south side of the land nearest his house, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>away across at the east side of Perfection City Brother
Dummy was thundering along with his waggon bringing
up his plough to the rescue, and that completed
all the horse-power of the Community. Little tongues
of flame here and there along the furrows denoted that
the back-firing had begun in several spots. Meanwhile
the sky was reddening up with the reflection
of the on-coming conflagration, and the fierce wind
blew ever harder directly from its long blood-red line.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now you jes’ set afire ’long hyar, front this hyar
furrow,” said Willette, kneeling down with her matches
and starting the fire as she spoke. “Now then, yo’
jes’ see to that, an’ don’t yo’ let that ar fire hop over
behind yer, or it’ll be worse nor nothin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What am I to do?” asked Olive trembling with
excitement and fear, it was all so strange and alarming.
“I never saw a fire and don’t know anything
about it,” she added.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jes’ paddle it out with yer shingle, ef it gits over.
There ain’t no sight o’ larnin’ wanted for that,” said
Willette in scorn. “Mind yer ends, and look after
tongues in the middle. They’ll be powerful handy
at jumpin’ over this hyar furrow, and you mustn’t let
the fire git away from yer, else yo’ll be clear done for.
Keep yer eyes behind yer and min’ the back line,” said
Willette walking away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Land o’ liberty! look at that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Willette made one bound behind Olive and commenced
furiously beating the ground with her wooden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>paddle, while Olive, bewildered, turned round to see
that she had indeed let the fire get behind her even
as Willette was uttering her warning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We ’uns would ha’ been clear burnt out in one
grasshopper’s jump on’y I was there,” said Willette
looking critically to see if any little spark of fire lingered
in the tall grass which could by any chance start
into life again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh I can never manage it! What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be spry and—Look at that again now!” Willette
sprang to a new place and beat the ground. She was
back again in an instant, here there and every where,
with the activity of a monkey, beating down for dear
life, whenever the fire crossed the narrow base-line
of the up-turned sod, and as the wind was high it was
frequently doing this. Constant vigilance was required,
especially as Ezra had only had time to run
a few furrows with the plough, instead of a band five
or six feet wide.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Powerful heavy work in this hyar high wind,”
said the child, “and on’y that ar furrow to start from.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Willette was in her element. Not an inch of the
line escaped her lynx-eye, and all the while she kept
giving advice to Olive, who stood in awe of her superior
practical knowledge in this emergency.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now this hyar fire’s agoin’ to spread along, an’
yo’ jes’ got ter mind this end by yerself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She darted twenty yards away and paddled out a
flame and came back, her face begrimed with smoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and dirt, so that she looked not unlike the nigger
whose modes of speech she so much affected.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You jes’ take off that ar hat and them big skirts,
else you’ll be burnt to death right hyar,” said Willette
surveying Olive with considerable disapproval.</p>

<p class='c010'>Willette’s hickory trousers and shirt were exactly
the thing for a prairie fire in a high wind, as indeed
they were for most of the occupations that fell to her
lot. What with the constant bounding backwards and
forwards over the flame, Olive indeed thought that
she had better accept the advice and slip off her wide
calico skirt which was forever in the way and might
easily catch fire. She put it along with her hat just
at the top of the slope where Weddell’s Gully began,
where she could easily get them next day, if all went
well.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was night now and would have been quite dark
but for the bright glare from the fire. All the inhabitants
of the Community were out working desperately.
Olive paddled down her fire and kept her line
bravely for a couple of hours, in spite of choking
smoke and clouds of dust and many a burn. Willette
was far away, lost in the darkness, following her end
of the fire, and only became visible as she leaped backwards
and forwards over her line of fire like some agile
fiend engaged in roasting its victims. Olive was all
alone. She felt very much frightened, for she did
not know what might happen, nor what in any new
emergency she would have to do. She wished somebody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>would come, for it was a strange experience to be
in the black night and lurid glare all alone minding a
fire. The air was full of the burnt fluff from the big
fire, and the roar as it now had come near was terrifying.
True the worst of it was passing to the south, and
their land was now pretty well guarded on all sides.
Suddenly the cheerful black face of Napoleon Pompey
appeared in the light of the flame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Pompey, I’m so glad you’ve come. Where
is everybody?” said Olive, overjoyed to see a human
being once more.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, Mis’ Ollie, I on’y jes’ take ole plough to
de bars. We’uns rip up dat furrow golly spry. Done
turn de hosses loose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, the poor horses will be burnt!” exclaimed
Olive in dismay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dem hosses, dey dre’ful cute critters. Dey go
off slap to de bottom lan’. You bet hosses knows
mos’ as well nor white folks ’bout prairie fires. I
come min’ yo’ fire fo’ yer, Mis’ Ollie. Ole man he
done tole me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, you can take my shingle then. There
is not much more, I suppose, to be done now, only
you must keep both edges between the two furrows
here. They told me not to let it get away and run
down into the Gully. Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You bet,” replied Napoleon Pompey who knew
far better than Olive could tell him just what should
be done.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“I am going to get my hat and skirt. I left them
near the corner of Weddell’s Gully. I think I will
just run across the old field and get them: it will be
much shorter than going all the way round by the
furrows. It will be light enough to see yet awhile so
I can follow the path through the Gully.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive looked at the fire that was fast roaring its
way towards the south-east, and deciding it would
easily light her on her way she tripped off and disappeared
in the gloom down towards the Gully.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a few minutes Napoleon Pompey began to show
signs of immense excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Golly Ned! I never seed yonder. Mis’ Ollie
whar yo’ be? Come back! Come back, Mis’ Ollie!
Golly! Golly!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He ran violently backwards and forwards along
his line of fire, which, however, he dared not leave,
exclaiming “Golly!” and “Oh Lordy!” at every
step. In a minute or two he ran into Ezra who was
coming along to fetch Olive home, if she was still
there.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lordy! dat yo’, Mas’r Ezra. Yo’ go right ’long
down dish hyar Gully. Mis’ Ollie she down dar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra was dead beat. He could scarcely drag his
limbs along. The terrific exertion of that furious
ploughing, coming at the end of a long and hard day’s
work, had almost over-taxed even his iron frame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought I would find her here on my way
home,” he said languidly. “We are pretty safe now.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Tell her to come back with the others. I’m going
home to get something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir-ee,” said Napoleon Pompey vehemently.
“You’ hain’t gwine ter do dat. Golly Ned! Yo’
dunno see. Mis’ Ollie she done gone down inter de
Gully, fetch ole hat. Dat fire. Yo’ see dat fire startin’
up yonder, she never seed dat, I didn’t see it nudder
nohow: dat fire’ll crope up an’ cotch her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My God! where is she?” cried Ezra, roused to
sudden energy as it dawned upon him what Napoleon
Pompey was explaining.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Down de Gully dar, she say she gwine down
dar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amongst those tall weeds and that fire coming
on! Oh my God!”</p>

<p class='c010'>His fatigue was all gone now. He leaped forward
and sprang with desperate bounds down the straggling
path towards Weddell’s Gully, where, in a deserted
field once tilled by that individual, prairie weeds
were growing to the height of six feet and more, they
had dry stalks and fluffy downy heads that would
burn like petroleum, if the fire once touch them. It
was down there that Olive had gone, all ignorant of
that tiny red line creeping slowly around the brow of
the hill, up against the wind, and now approaching
that very spot with vicious little tongues of red flame.
No wonder Ezra bounded along the pathway, no wonder
his heart beat ready to burst, and no wonder if
his voice sounded harsh and choking as he cried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Olive! Olive! Olive!” again and again until his
brain reeled. He got no answer except the crackle of
the fire. He stumbled along not knowing which way
to turn, and twice fell forward as his foot caught in
the tangled grass. He staggered to his feet and raising
his agonised face cried in a harsh whisper, “Oh
God! my wife, my wife!” He tried to shout again,
but his dry throat made no articulate sound. His
temples seemed bursting, he dashed forward blindly,
not knowing where to look for Olive in the horrid
darkness, soon to be turned into still more horrid
light. His foot struck against an old rail at the edge
of Weddell’s deserted field, he fell heavily, hitting his
head against the projecting end of the rail, rolled over
and lay still. The little flames crept nearer and nearer
lapping out their malicious red tongues as if in anticipation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Madame had worked hard with the rest in beating
back the fire, and now that she saw that their united
efforts had been successful and that Perfection City
was safe, she, in company with Balthasar, was going
the circuit of the defences of their home, just to see
that there remained nothing further for her to do.
In the course of time she came to Napoleon Pompey,
who was in charge of the last scrap of back-firing, intent
on maintaining guard and on effecting a complete
junction of the two lines of fire, so as not to
leave so much as a handsbreadth of standing grass
whereby the enemy might even at the last minute
burst in upon them. This finishing of the circle was
important, and the lad was in the midst of his work
and his distress when Madame loomed out through the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Lordy, dey is both burned, dey is! Oh
Lordy! Oh Lordy,” cried Napoleon Pompey the instant
he set eyes upon Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who is burned?” asked Madame in bewilderment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>well used to the extravagant modes of speech
indulged in by negroes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mis’ Ollie an’ Mas’r Ezra fo’ shu’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you mad, fool, what do you mean?” said
Madame furiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mis’ Ollie done gone in der Gully ter fetch ole
hat, an’ de fire’s crope up, an’ it’ll cotch her, oh Lordy!
oh Lordy! An’ Mas’r Ezra he done gone ter fin’ her
down dar,” said the boy, beginning to whimper.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame gripped his shoulder with a grasp of iron.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be quiet, and tell me what you mean. Sister
Olive has gone home, I passed her myself with her
hat under her arm, and she told me to tell Ezra she
had gone back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“De Lord be praised!” ejaculated Napoleon Pompey.
“Den it’s on’y Mas’r Ezra’ll be burnt. Yah, you
lemme go!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This exclamation was in answer to the sudden
pressure of Madame’s hand, which was like the clutch
of a vice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Ezra? Tell me or I’ll wring your neck,”
she said in a voice the like of which Napoleon Pompey
had never heard before in his life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Down dar,” said he terrified, pointing to the
Gully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Show me where he started from.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame still kept her hand upon Napoleon
Pompey who hurried to the spot where Ezra had
stood.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Dar’s his shingle, what he done drap when he
run.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha!” said Madame pouncing upon the shingle.
“Here, Balthasar, here sweetheart!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The dog came up to her, and she passed her trembling
hands over his long ears and whispered to him
half crying, half coaxing. “Here, dear heart, do this
for me or I die.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She put the shingle to his nose. He sniffed, raised
his long and pointed head. Then she lay upon the
ground coaxing him to put his nose down. He sniffed
again, took a step to the right, to the left, back, then
forward. Madame followed clasping the shingle to
her bosom and murmuring cooing words of love to her
dog. He raised his great tan head and gave a long
deep bay that echoed far and wide.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Golly! She gwine ter run him down like he
nigger slave,” said Napoleon Pompey with a shiver,
as he heard the dog’s voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Balthasar set off and Madame kept close at his
heels. It was easy enough, for the trail was fresh and
strong. In three minutes they stood beside the motionless
form of Ezra at the brink of the tall weeds,
and Balthasar whined in anxiety as Madame lifted his
head and called upon him in agonised tones. Just
then the sky was lit up with a lurid glare. The first
red tongue had tasted the dry fluffy weeds on Weddell’s
abandoned farm. Madame, startled by the flame,
sprang to her feet and gave one hasty glance around.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Ezra lay motionless. She stepped a few paces into
the shorter grass of the ordinary prairie and set it on
fire. The little ring of flame spread on all sides, like
the ripple from a stone cast into still water. Then
she paddled out the fire on the side next Ezra, and the
ripple of fire continued to spread rapidly in a sort of
broken circle. The roar of the burning weeds was
like the on-coming of an avalanche. Madame turned
to Ezra and seizing him under the shoulders dragged
him backwards within the safety of her oasis of burnt
prairie. He was a big man and a heavy one, but her
arm seemed endowed with more than mortal strength.
She dragged him further and further within the circle,
and then seeing that he was out of all danger, she sat
down beside him and took his head in her lap. She
opened his collar and fanned him with her hat. The
now brightly burning weeds made it light as day, and
she could see that he looked pale even under the
blackened smoke that smeared his face, but his pulse
was beating, he was only hurt and stunned, not dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>Balthasar was terrified. Ringed round by fire and
with the ground where he stood still smoking hot,
what dog would not be alarmed? He lifted up his
voice once more in a long howl, and then sniffing at
Ezra gave a sweeping lick with his tongue all over his
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! Ollie! Where are you? Come!” said Ezra,
roused by this combined demonstration. He raised
his head in a weak and bewildered way. Madame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>placed her hand on his forehead as he sank down again.
He put his own hand up and taking hers said: “Little
wife!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame shivered, and then steadying her voice
said, “Olive is quite safe!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra started up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, what are you doing here? Where is my
wife?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I came to tell you that Olive had gone home,
and that she had got her hat all right. She never
was in any danger at all. It was a mistake on the
part of that negro boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame!” began Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear friend,” said she.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel so strange and bewildered, I don’t seem
to know what has happened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lay your head down again,” said Madame, very
gently. “You have had a blow. You will soon be
all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra’s head sank again into her lap. He gave a
deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You came down here into the Gully after Olive
who, according to the negro, had gone in search
of her hat. You could not surely have realized
that the fire was coming up against the wind and
that it would be death to be caught among the
weeds.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I knew, I knew,” said Ezra. “That was why I
came. Olive was here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“But she wasn’t, she never had been here at all,”
interrupted Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shouted, but no answer came. I could not
find Olive. I remember the awful agony of it. My
head seemed turning to fire and I couldn’t find Olive.
I don’t remember any more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You fell and knocked yourself senseless,” said
Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Olive safe? Tell me, are you sure Olive is
safe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t I tell you I passed her on her way home?”
said Madame a little sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But this fire!” exclaimed Ezra, starting up.
“We must get out of this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush, lie down again,” said Madame, her voice
dropping again into its tone of caressing entreaty.
“Your head must be still giddy or you would perceive
that we are surrounded. We can’t get out until
the fires meet and extinguish each other. Rest and be
patient.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra saw that this was true. They were entirely
surrounded by a ring of retreating fire, the heat from
which was oppressive. He sat down again, but did
not lay his head in Madame’s lap. Perhaps it was because
he felt less giddy.</p>

<p class='c010'>He asked her how she came there, and Madame
very briefly told him, dwelling not at all upon her
share in finding him, but rather upon the sagacity of
Balthasar. Ezra, however, was not to be deceived.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“You risked your life for me this night, Madame,”
he said slowly, when she had finished speaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Possibly. I never thought about it. I could
not leave you here to die, to be burnt to death. Had
the case been reversed you would have come to my
rescue.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are the most generous of mortals, the noblest
of women,” said Ezra earnestly. “It was assuredly
the brightest day of my life that led me across
your path. You taught me how to live, and to-night
your generous hand has saved me from death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush!” said Madame faintly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I owe my life to you,” repeated Ezra. “What
shall I do to repay such a debt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I a usurer that I should exact my pound of
flesh?” answered Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Usurer!” exclaimed Ezra. “That is indeed the
last word to be applied to you. Is a usurer one who
is always giving? Giving from her wealth freely and
without stint? Is a usurer one who is ever helping
and directing into the paths of righteousness those
who are feeble and faltering of step? Ah, Madame,
I never can half tell you all that I owe you! How
narrow and selfish would my life have been but for
you! Devoted to petty cares, absorbed in personal
ambitions, rejoicing in sordid gains,—such would have
been my fate, only Providence brought me to you to
be taught, guided, elevated, purified. My life is yours,
you have made it, dearest, wisest, best, of friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“And Olive?” said Madame quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, there too shall be your handiwork seen,”
said Ezra. “My little Olive is very young. Sometimes
I think her mind is even younger than her body,
and she is barely twenty, you know, a mere child and
easily moulded.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame remembering her last encounter with
Olive, seemed to recall very little that was either
childlike or plastic in the concluding portion of their
conversation, but she did not say so to Ezra who went
on talking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She often, however, puzzles me, she has such
sudden freaks and fancies, as if her heart was a wild
creature not fully tamed and ever dashing against
the bars of its environment. I sometimes feel that
I have not the necessary wisdom or tact to guide and
counsel her. She seems to need someone who is wiser
and more skilful than I am. Sometimes I fear she
does not quite realise the responsibilities of life. The
problems which have come up before us and which
cry aloud for solution, seem to her but trivial matters
that may be trusted to settle themselves. We must
endeavour, dear friend, to arouse Olive’s enthusiasm
about Perfection City. She is capable of the highest
and noblest aspirations, but her heart must be turned
into the right direction. She evinces a certain hesitancy
in throwing herself into our work and aims.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps she is opposed to the whole thing,” suggested
Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“That cannot be,” replied Ezra earnestly. “She
must see as we do, when she comes thoroughly to
understand our motives in founding Perfection City.
I look to you, Madame, to open her eyes to the truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” said Madame laconically, and then she
added, after a moment’s pause, “I will ask you to
do one thing for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything you ask I will do if it is in my power,”
said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not tell Olive of your fall here, nor of the
danger you were in, nor of my coming to find you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After a moment of puzzled silence Ezra said, “Of
course your wishes are to me law. But may I ask
why you make such a request?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps I am judging wrongly, but I am acting
as if Olive had the same feelings as I should have.
If I were in her place, I should hate it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?” asked Ezra in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame rose up, her pale face illumined by the
light of the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I loved a man,” she said, beginning very
quietly, but her voice gathered in intensity as she
spoke. “If I loved a man, I could not bear it. To
think that my love had failed him in his sorest need.
He was lying stunned, helpless, within the clutch of
deadly peril, and I went home unwarned, leaving
him to his fate, all unconscious of the whole thing,
while another woman—not I, but another woman—went
to his rescue, another woman—not I—found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>him, saved him, drew him out of danger, while I
walked heedlessly home. I should hate myself, I
should hate—ah! I should hate to the verge of killing
that other woman who had saved him. That is the
way I should feel, if I loved.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She concluded hastily, her voice dropping to a
whisper. Ezra looked up at her in amazement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yours is a many-sided nature. I never suspected
you could feel like that. I never thought of you as
being—as capable of——” he stopped in confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah yes! You never thought of me as being able
to love—to love a man and not an impersonal cause.
Ah yes! You never quite looked upon me as a mere
woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have always regarded you as something higher
than a mere woman,” said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Listen,” she said, sitting down again beside him.
“You have yet to know me—the woman, I mean,
and not the pioneer of Perfection City. My father
was a man of passionate nature. He had fine instincts,
but these were not developed. He was a Russian
noble. I come of very good blood, as they say in the
old world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I always knew you were of distinguished birth,”
said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at all, quite the contrary,” said Madame,
with a laugh that sounded harsh. “My father was
a wild, self-willed Russian noble. He was to have
married a lady of princely house, only that he refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>to do one thing which they made a condition of
the marriage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To give up my mother. Do you understand?
He could not marry the princess, and he sacrificed
wealth, position, and worldly honour, because he
would not give up the pale-haired English girl whom
he loved passionately, and who was my mother. She
died, and my father died too, not many years afterwards.
He did what he could for me by leaving me
his fortune and the permission to bear his name, to
which I had no legal right. From my mother I inherited
my brain, but my heart I inherited from my
father. Now let us go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Must we?” said Ezra, to whom Madame’s sudden
confession had been full of interest. “There is nothing
further for us to do. Perfection City is safe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we must return to real life, Brother Ezra.
Sitting here, ringed around with fire, we were alone
in a world of our own. For a few moments we lived
for each other, as it were. Our spirits communed, and
I opened my heart to you as never before to mortal
being. Now we must go back to real life again. See
the fires are all out, and the world is itself again—all
dark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra rose to his feet and staggered a little, as Madame
perceived from the stumble he made. She seemed
preternaturally acute, and to be able to understand by
the help of some new sense, for she put out her hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and touched his arm, “Lean on me, brother, you are
still giddy from your accident. We will walk very
slowly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra, feeling indeed faint enough, gratefully accepted
the proffered help and put his hand within her
arm; thus very slowly they started back towards the
house through the inky black night. “Friend, what
I said is to be locked in your breast, a secret,” said
Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fully understand that,” replied Ezra, “and I
feel it a high honour that you should have chosen me
as the repository of the secret of your life. It is safe,
nay more, it is sacred, with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It took them a long time in the intense darkness
to reach Ezra’s house where a light was glimmering
from the window. When they at length reached
the bars, Madame said, “I will not go in. Oh, I
know what you would say, but I would prefer
not. Olive would resent my bringing you back to
her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mistake Olive utterly,” said Ezra earnestly.
“Believe me, hers is a simple nature, she would have
no such feelings as you think.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you are right, and that she is a child
in mind and not yet a woman in heart. Possibly I
endow her with feelings she could not even understand.
I judge her by myself, and maybe all the while
her little soul is possessed with nothing but content
at the thought that her pretty hat is all safe. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>butterfly must not be blamed if it does not rise as
high as the lark. Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was waiting for him impatiently, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh Ezra, where have you been? And isn’t your
face black? You are every whit as black as Napoleon
Pompey. Wasn’t it fun?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fun? What was fun?” asked Ezra languidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, the fire of course, now that it is all over.
It was so exciting. I was as hungry as a hawk when
I came in. I really could not wait, so I had supper.
You must have yours this very minute. Do you know,
it is one o’clock at night, and you have not tasted a
morsel of food since twelve o’clock yesterday? Do
you realize that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She bustled around and got his supper ready, chatting
brightly all the while over the incidents of the
fire, making fun and merriment out of them all. Ezra
sat stupidly watching her, his head throbbing so heavily
that he could scarcely think. He could eat nothing
when the supper was ready, and Olive felt aggrieved.
“I think you might, just to please me. It would do
you good, for you must be hungry, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He swallowed a few morsels and said he would go
to bed, that rest was what he most needed, his head
ached badly. He was thankful she made no inquiries
after his adventures during that eventful night. He
would have found it difficult to tell a connected tale
with that pain in his head. He asked Olive if she
had gone down into the Gully.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“No,” she said, “I started to go, but it was darker
than I thought, so I came up again and followed round
by the high prairie where there was a chance of meeting
somebody. I came home with Willette.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fire did get into the old field after all,” said
Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And were the weeds burnt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I wish I had been there to see. Wasn’t it
a lovely blaze-up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it blazed up,” said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive didn’t notice that he seemed ill, he thought
with some bitterness. Madame would have divined
it, no matter how hard he had tried to conceal the
fact. After all, it was not her fault that she was made
differently. The butterfly was not to be blamed if
it did not soar as high as the lark.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>COTTERELL “WANTED.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The day after the fire was an idle one at Perfection
City. No one felt able to work, Ezra least of
all. He lay upon the floor of the kitchen with a wet
handkerchief on his head, and several times he asked
Olive not to make so much noise. She was as still as
a mouse, she thought, but then his head ached, poor
fellow! So she went out and sat in the shade of the
house among her morning-glories, while the hens
walked about with their wings down and their tongues
lolling out, trying to cool themselves. The black burnt
prairie seemed to send up shafts of heat to the
copper-coloured sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>A man rode up to the bars, and for one moment
Olive’s heart stood still. She feared it might be Mr.
Cotterell, whom she had not seen since the day at
the spring, now some weeks past. It was not Mr.
Cotterell, however, but one of the settlers from the
other side of Cotton Wood Creek. He came forward
with his bridle-rein over his arm, his horse following,
head down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Wal, how’d you ’uns git ’long with that pesky
fire?” he observed, without any preliminary greeting.
He was a Missouri man, and they often prided themselves
on their rudeness. It was their way of showing
their independence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good morning, Mr. Owen,” said Olive, who knew
the man quite well. “We have escaped all right,
thank you. I hope you were not injured?” She was
extra careful in her manner, as the politeness for two
had all to be furnished by herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yer hain’t been burnt out I see. You all’s mighty
silly anyhow. Why in thunder didn’t yer back-fire
before? ’Tain’t agin’ yer principles, is it?” Mr.
Owen grinned under the impression that he was
funny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We didn’t back-fire, because we thought it wrong
to start a fire in such a wind and let it possibly burn
up our neighbours,” said Olive stiffly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then ’tis agin yer principles to back-fire, by
Gosh! The boys was ’lowing as much over to Union
Mills.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is against our principles to injure our neighbours.
You don’t object to that, Mr. Owen, do you?”
said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I reckon you’ll git mighty tired o’ them idees ef
yer live long on the prairie,” observed Mr. Owen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seen ole man Cotterell lately?” he inquired suddenly,
half shutting his green-grey eyes and looking
at Olive intently.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>She was somewhat surprised at the question, but
knowing from experience how inquisitive the average
settler is, she answered readily enough.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I haven’t seen him for a long time. Was he
burnt out? I didn’t know the fire had gone so far.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I calkerlate he warn’t tetched by the fire,” said
Mr. Owen, very slowly. He made long pauses between
his remarks, during which he continued unremittingly
the steady occupation of his life, namely,
chewing tobacco. Olive began to feel impatient. She
did not like to ask him into the house for fear of
disturbing Ezra, so she sat down again in her chair,
and pointing to a log of wood which lay near and
seated on which he could still hold his horse, she
asked him to take a seat also. Mr. Owen sat down
with a grunt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never seed ony pusson so sot on posies as you
’uns be,” he observed conversationally.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I am very fond of flowers. They make
the house more home-like, I think. The prairie is
very bare looking,” replied Olive politely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yer ole man oughter rared his house t’other side
the Gully, an’ further down yon’er. This hyar ’ull
be powerful col’ when we git col’ snaps in Jan’ary.
Yer dunno nothin’ ’bout things in this hyar all-fired
’Fection City,” said Mr. Owen, looking around him
in criticism.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps not,” said Olive, rather nettled, “but
we know how to mind our own business.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Mr. Owen did not feel one whit abashed. He was
far too near akin to the pachyderms for Olive’s delicate
little shafts to have any effect on him. Another
long silence followed, and Olive began to wonder if
Owen was like that man from Jacksonville, who came
to see them once and stayed four hours, during which
time he made only two remarks and they possessed
no particular interest. The man and his stony silence
had driven her nearly wild, until she reflected how
much more awful it would have been had she been
obliged to entertain him with conversation. A recollection
of this visitation and a dread born of that
recollection began to invade her mind. Mr. Owen,
however, was not going to stay for four hours, and he
was going to make a remark of very particular interest,
a remark that would quickly scatter all Olive’s other
ideas. He delivered it slowly and with the monotonous
enunciation which proclaimed him a Missouri man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The boys is hout huntin’ down ole man Cotterell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” exclaimed Olive turning very white.
Then, steadying her voice as well as she could she
said, “Why are they hunting him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To cotch him,” replied her visitor concisely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what for?” asked Olive, looking at him with
wide eyes of horror. She knew only too well what
hunting down a man portended.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, there’s bin a shootin’ over to his house,
an’ one o’ thim boys o’ Mills is shot, shot dead. Cotterell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>done it. And now he’s gone an’ run off. The
boys they ’lowed Cotterell best be hung this time.
Las’ time he was let off. He won’t be agin, you
bet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know he has shot young Mills?
What evidence have you of it?” asked Olive in terror,
yet she could not help pressing the man to tell her,
although each word was like a stab.</p>

<p class='c010'>He gave a silent inward laugh as if his thoughts
were facetious. “Evidence an’ enough,” he said.
“Jake Mills’ body with a bullet through his heart.
Yer can’t git nothin’ plainer in the way of evidence
than that, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how do you know it was Mr. Cotterell shot
him?” asked Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Damn my eyes! but yer mus’ be a nateral born
fool, Mis’ Weston. Jake Mills were foun’ on Cotterell’s
lan’. Who else could ha’ done it? Besides, he
did, an’ that’s a fac’ anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think it is perfectly monstrous,” burst out
Olive, trembling with agitation. “I never heard of
a wickeder thing. Here is this man you have decided
to hang, and you don’t even know if he has done
the thing you accuse him of. If that is what you call
prairie law and justice I can only say I never heard
of a more sinful and unjust law. Black savages
couldn’t do worse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mos’ like the boys will let him hev a trial, ef
he’s partic’lar sot on’t. That won’t si’nify nothin’,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>said Mr. Owen, again surveying Olive through the
narrow aperture of his half-closed eyes, and again applying
himself to his habitual occupation with vigour.
She looked at him with a face in which horror and
disgust struggled for mastery.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If this horrid murder is committed by your
neighbours, Mr. Owen, I shall think that prairie men
are a disgrace to civilization,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We prairie folks ain’t partic’lar sot on civilization,”
remarked Mr. Owen with affability.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you’ll never catch him,” said Olive, with
a sound very like a sob in her voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The boys they ’lowed you’uns was mighty good
frien’s o’ his’n, an’ he’d a mos’ likely come this hyar
way to make for the Pottawattamie ’fore we’uns could
cotch him. That’s why I come ’long ter look for him
hyar,” observed Mr. Owen, rising and putting his
head under his saddle flap in order to tighten up the
girth a couple of holes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you’ve come here to spy out, have you?”
said Olive, in passionate anger. “Why didn’t you
say so at first, and ask the question like a man, and
not come sneaking around? Do you want to hunt all
over the house and see if we’ve got anybody hidden
away?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said Owen slowly. “Guess that’ll do. I
ain’t agoin’ ter hunt roun’. We ain’t no great shakes
at bein’ fine folks out hyar on the prairie, but we
allers takes the word of a lady, by Gosh. You said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>you hain’t seen nothin’ o’ ole man Cotterell, guess
that’ll do for the boys. Mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Owen rode away, feeling that in the contest
of politeness that morning he had certainly scored off
Mrs. Weston with her stuck-up Eastern ways.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was in an agony of doubt and terror. That
the boys were out hunting for Cotterell was, she knew,
but the preliminary to his death, if they caught him.
The boys seldom or never let off any one they caught,
so she gathered from the stories she had heard of their
doings in time past. What was she to do in this difficult
dilemma? Should she tell Ezra?</p>

<p class='c010'>Under ordinary circumstances her first impulse
would have been to go straight to her husband with
the story she had heard, but in this instance she felt
that such a course would be impossible. She knew
that Ezra was jealous of Mr. Cotterell, he had betrayed
his feelings more than once, and in her heart
she knew that few men can be just towards the man
who arouses their jealousy. Her husband was a very
just man, and could, more than any one she knew,
put himself in the place of others and see what was
right and what was wrong. But in this instance it
was not justice Olive wanted, it was justice that she
feared. Although she spoke bravely enough to Owen,
a terrible fear lurked in her breast that the evidence,
though ludicrously deficient by the rules of procedure
that obtain in old established communities, was quite
sufficient to convince a prairie jury. Ezra would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>sit on a hanging jury, nor would he be a party to
catching Mr. Cotterell, but his sense of justice and
what was due to the principles professed at Perfection
City might carry him no further than this passively
inactive point? Would he assist Cotterell to escape?
Guilty or not, that was what Olive wanted, and to
help in such an undertaking, she felt sure, was what
her husband might very well refuse to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>Was Cotterell guilty? Olive debated this point
anxiously in her mind. She knew he went armed,
but so did many other men. In fact, to be armed
was the rule on the prairie. The doctrine of non-resistance
was one of the least understood tenets of the
Pioneers at Perfection City, and was observed by nobody
else on the prairie. Even Brother Wright, as
we have seen—though Olive was quite unaware of
this—had granted to himself a special indulgence in
this matter. So the mere fact of Mr. Cotterell’s always
having his revolver in his belt did not really count
for anything, one way or the other. He had always
been so gentle and so chivalrous in his manner to her,
she found it difficult to force her mind to keep hold
of the fact that he was a very passionate man. Everyone
said so, and she knew, too, that the Mills’ were
a bad lot, drunken quarrelsome men, who, as Ezra
said, combined in their character all the vices of the
prairie and preserved none of its virtues. How easy
it would be for a proud, passionate man like Mr.
Cotterell to bring his revolver into a heated argument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>with Jake Mills, who might be mad with drink. But
surely such a shooting was not murder according to
prairie law. In her distress Olive found herself falling
back upon the probable laxity of that very prairie
justice which a short time before she had so scornfully
characterised to Owen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “boys” who were hunting Cotterell were,
as Olive well knew, the most relentless men on the
prairie, regular settlers who had found by experience
that the only way to keep order was to keep it with
their own right hands. They had hung several horse-thieves
lately, and had declared they were going to
put a stop to the “shooting round promiscuous” of
the younger blades. They were not unjust men, but
they were hasty, and were moreover already terribly
prejudiced against Cotterell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having decided that it was best not to tell Ezra
what she had heard, Olive was immediately assailed
with a hundred doubts. Suppose Mr. Cotterell came
to them in his extremity, should she try to conceal
him? But how utterly impossible to do so without
the co-operation of her husband! The mere attempt
to do such a thing might involve her in difficulties
without being of any use to the unhappy man himself.
Then there was Madame. Should she appeal
to her for help? Her heart revolted from such a
course. After their last meeting, when they had interchanged
hot words on the subject of this very man,
Olive felt it was impossible to ask Madame’s aid or to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>tell her anything about it. Then there was no one,
and Olive resolved to keep the secret of what she
had heard, hoping that something might turn up
which would justify her action, or at least make any
further action unnecessary. Thus do people often put
off on the shoulders of chance the burden of a decision
which taxes too much their powers of forecasting
events. It was a heavy secret to keep to herself, and
her face looked white and scared as she entered the
kitchen on tip-toe to see how Ezra felt. He roused
up as she came in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am better now, little woman,” he said in answer
to her inquiries. “The pain is all gone. I will
get up and begin to stir around again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He went out with her and with the keenness which
is soon a habit with a prairie man, he noticed the
hoof-marks of Owen’s horse, where it had stamped
rather briskly, owing to the flies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who has been here? Those are fresh,” he said,
pointing to the marks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That man from over beyond Cotton Wood Creek
was here a little while ago, Owen is his name: you
know the man,” said Olive, with a beating heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cattle-hunting after the fire, I suppose. Were
they burnt out yesterday?” asked Ezra, with slight
show of interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I believe not, he did not say. He sneered
at the Pioneers for not having safe-guarded themselves,
heedless of the welfare of the other settlers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>so I suppose he had been betimes with his back-firing,
at least if he lives up to his principles,” remarked
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is too late to go and hunt for our horses,”
said Ezra, “and I feel too tired to start out on foot
after them. They may very well be five miles away
by this time. Did you ask Owen if he had seen
them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I never thought of doing so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t forget always to ask everyone if they have
seen your horses whenever they are out on the prairie:
it is one of the golden rules of prairie life,” said Ezra,
tapping her chin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he wouldn’t have known Queen Katharine
and Rebel even if he did happen to meet them,” objected
Olive. “How could he know one pair of strange
horses from another?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bless your sweet eyes, Owen knows every horse
and cow belonging to his neighbours for a radius of
ten miles from his house, at the very least. Telling
a neighbour where his cattle are, is the only rule of
politeness known to many of them, and they are punctilious
about it,” said Ezra laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I had known that, because I found him
deficient in many of the rules I have been taught,”
said Olive. “Possibly he found me as lacking, according
to his estimate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra did not go out to hunt for the horses
the next morning as he had intended. Other work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>which seemed more important, turned up for him.
Brother Wright came that same evening to arrange
about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good evening, friends,” he said. “I trust you
are both rested after yesterday. It was a hard day
and a harder night. Brother Ezra, you did splendidly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We were much alarmed for the safety of Perfection
City: I don’t think it is ever likely to be in
greater danger,” said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I suppose, not from the outside,” said
Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And we are not likely to be set on fire
from the inside, are we?” observed Ezra with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Accidents may happen,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Even in the best regulated communities,” added
Brother Wright. “However, what I came to talk
about was the future, and not the past. We’ve got
two good loads of corn ready, it ought to be sold at
once in Mapleton. We’ll get top price. I stepped
into Madame’s as I came along, and she agreed with
me. We must sell at once. Brother Dummy has got
his waggon loaded up ready to start. It is a marvel
how much that man does get through in the way of
work. Well, the question is, who will go with the
corn? Brother Dummy must drive his own team,
because no other man could manage that black horse
for half an hour. Biting Bill would kick the waggon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>into match-wood in two minutes, if any of us attempted
to touch his reins. I wonder whether it is
the absolutely silent driving which cows him? You
are out and out the best one for attending to business
of any here. Madame thinks it would be well for you
to go, and so do I.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am quite ready,” replied Ezra. “But my horses
are both out on the prairie. I turned them loose after
the fire to let them run off to the Creek, as I had no
time to put them up and feed them. To-day I did not
feel able to hunt after them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, suppose you take my team, and I will
find your horses for you to-morrow. Will that
do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, then I’ll go to Mapleton.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The corn is already shucked, it won’t take half
an hour to load up. You and I will do it while the
horses are feeding. You ought to get off by six, I
will feed the horses at five.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Each spoke of <i>his</i> horses and <i>his</i> waggons much
in the same way as an artillery officer speaks of his
guns. There were three pairs of horses in the Community,
and, in theory at least, everyone was equally
free to use them, but experience showed that that sort
of handling did not suit horses, who do better if left
always in the care of the same persons. Therefore
it came about that Brother Dummy always had Biting
Bill, since no one else could manage the brute, and
Ezra generally had Queen Katharine and Rebel, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Brother Wright kept the greys. Now these animals,
although common property, were invariably spoken of
by their drivers as <i>theirs</i>, for the use of certain familiar
phrases, which to the outsider might seem to denote
the idea of private property, came naturally to
their lips. It is often more difficult to change habits
of speech than laws of property. Reformers who
start out to alter the whole course of modern ideas and
to rearrange the world according to a plan of their
own devising, would do well to meditate upon this
peculiarity and see what it points to. Surely so slight
a thing as a word might easily be eradicated from
human speech, and yet how difficult it is to do so.
But the point to consider is that the pertinacity, which
shows itself in modes of expression, may very well
exist in just as strong a form in habits of thought
and feeling. The Pioneers, like others of that sort,
passed over and disregarded such expressions as “my
horse,” “my waggon,” and “your plough,” not apparently
recognizing that the expressions denoted a habit
of thought that might very easily strike at the very
root of their institution. They were communists, as
Olive had said, in bits of this and scraps of that, but
the old leaven of individualism was there still among
them, only dormant. The Pioneers never expected
that the leaven would again become an active principle.
Like other people, they were unable to see into the
future, and therefore rejoiced in their escape from
the perils of the prairie fire and considered that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>had no further danger to apprehend for this winter
at least. The sea was smooth and the sky was serene,
so to speak, and they did not perceive the sunken
rocks that lay in the track of their experimental
bark.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>IN QUEST OF NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Olive was early astir the next morning, in order
to see her husband off and also to provide him with
food in ample abundance to last him for the trip. He
carried a plentiful store of dried beef, a portable commodity
much in request on the prairie. The old trappers
had showed the settlers how to make it, and the
trappers had acquired the art from the Indians. Dried
beef is precisely what its name indicates. It is raw
beef, somewhat salted, and then dried in the sun until
it is like a piece of solid leather. It has to be cut into
thin slices across the grain before the stoutest teeth
can make the slightest impression upon it. It may
be also cooked in a batter of eggs for the dainty, but
has only to be sliced up with a jack-knife to be eaten
by the average teamster on the prairie. Besides the
dried meat and plenty of corn-bread, Ezra had milk
in a bottle and one of Olive’s wedding presents to eat,
namely, a tin of peaches. He travelled therefore in
extreme luxury. He set off along with Brother Dummy
just as the sun was rising, and the canvas covers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>of the waggons showed for a long time as two moving
white specks as they slowly crept across the blackened
landscape, finally disappearing behind the Mounds
some twelve miles to the west of Perfection City.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive remained alone at home with Napoleon Pompey
and Diana to keep her company, until Ezra should
return in four days’ time. It was only with great reluctance
that he had consented to this. He did not at
all like the idea of her remaining alone in the house.
As usual, when it came to Olive doing what the ordinary
prairie settler’s wife did as a matter of course,
Ezra’s love took fright. He urged her to go and stay
at Madame’s house, she would be more than welcome,
he declared, in fact it seemed to him almost necessary
that she should go, and he insisted strongly upon the
plan. Olive was as strongly opposed to it. Why
couldn’t she stay in her own house? She would much
prefer it, so as to be on hand to feed the chickens and
milk the cows and generally see to things. Besides,
she felt quite sure she would be vastly in Madame’s
way. Ezra combated this position vigorously. Olive
could not be in anyone’s way, even if she tried. Moreover,
was not Madame a communist like the rest of
them, and she would be only too pleased to take Olive
into her home as she had already done into her heart.
His spouse made no comment, except a mental one, to
this argument, but reiterated her preference for staying
at home. It would only be three days or four at
most, and she would be very busy. Ezra hinted at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>possible danger if it were known she was alone in the
house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I won’t be alone: there is Napoleon Pompey
for one and Diana for two. Surely between so stout
a pair nothing on earth can happen to me,” she said,
smiling at his anxious face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t feel easy about you,” said Ezra, looking at
her with mournful eyes. “I never left you alone
before, and it suddenly seems to me a most portentous
thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you dear silly old thing!” exclaimed Olive,
“I do believe you’ll have omens next, and will look
into tea-cups to see if it is a propitious moment for
the success of this undertaking. I never knew you
‘take on’ like this before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never did so, but it is all because I love you,
dear. I quite understand what it means, to be foolish
with love. I used not to know what it was. I wonder
do women ever feel the same as we men do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Women, my dear, are sent into this world for
the express purpose of making men do what they ought
and not be silly,” said Olive severely. “Now I know
you’ll have the feed for the horses all right, but remember
the feed for yourself is in this basket, everything
you’ll want, and there is salt for the boiled
eggs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When the hurry of getting the waggons off was
over, Olive sat down to think, and immediately there
rose up before her the image of a hunted man flying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>for his life. In some ways it was a relief that Ezra
was gone, she would not have to be constantly making
an effort to hide the real anxiety in her mind. Then
she thought of Ezra and of his great and boundless
devotion to her, and the words Madame had spoken in
her wrath rose up before her and rebuked her. Were
they true? Had she hidden her real nature from her
husband before her marriage? She had never meant
to do so, but in their long pre-nuptial conversations
it had not appeared to her that she and Ezra were so
different in their views of life and its duties as perhaps
was now the case. He certainly had told her of the
experiment of Perfection City, and she had accepted
him and the experiment together because they were
indissoluble. She of herself would never have initiated
the communistic idea; but then there was nothing
wonderful in that, woman never do initiate anything,
they only follow some man’s lead with more or less
enthusiasm and intelligence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Were she to have expressed her own private predilection,
it certainly would have been for a little
home of her own on the usual lines, which little home
it would have been her pride and her pleasure to make
as beautiful as she could. Olive did not possess a large
and speculative mind, capable of vast dreamy projects,
whose limitless possibilities were in imagination not
checked by small practical obstacles. On the contrary,
it was the tendency of her intellect to perceive
those obstacles with startling clearness, and to demonstrate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>by a few biting truisms, the impossibility of
turning the dreamy vastnesses to use. She was neither
hard-headed nor dull-headed, but hers was a practical
nature, very much jarred by idle vapourings, and
above all she was kept in the straight path of common
sense by her keen appreciation of the ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c010'>This faculty enabled her to perceive how often reformers
run off the track of common sense, and while
pinning their faith to one particular little tenet which
they constitute the corner-stone of their philosophy,
lose sight of the whole world beyond. Olive possessed
in a high degree the sense of proportion, which in a
true reformer is generally absent. When Ezra with
his cultivated mind and really fine intellect, talked
to her of the reforming of the present type of civilization,
and briefly sketched out what he hoped would
be the result of the introduction of the communistic
idea into life, she could not help remarking that he
used very much the same expressions, and seemed animated
by very much the same hopes, as those indulged
in by one of the dietetic reformers she knew in Smyrna,
who promised all the glories of the golden age to mankind
if the human race would only give up the baneful
practices of eating meat and of cooking vegetables!</p>

<p class='c010'>And every few minutes, across the mirror of her
reflections, there came a shadow of a desperate man
spurring on a jaded horse. Olive could not shake off
a sense of impending disaster, but unlike Ezra, who
attributed his melancholy to his great love for Olive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>and a vague, unreasoning dread of something happening
to her in his absence, she knew quite well what
she feared and why.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the morning wore on, Olive began to feel it
impossible to remain quietly at home in the midst
of her anxiety. She must go out and hear what news
there was, or at all events she must learn if there was
any news. Resolved not to hold any communication
with Madame other than what was publicly necessary—for
between the two there was now maintained a
sort of armed neutrality—she decided to call at the
blacksmith’s, as Brother Green was in the way of most
of the gossip, if gossip is a term that could be rightly
applied to the feeble and intermittent stream of prairie
news that trickled through the smithy. Brother
Green was a silent, self-absorbed man who worked
steadily and brought much personal devotion into the
project of Perfection City. He was a lonely man,
a widower, and to judge by appearances a disappointed
man as well. He was surprised to see Sister Olive,
and very pleased, but could not shake hands as he was
very dirty, and she looked so brightly clean. Having
wiped a wooden bench with his leather apron and
again with the sleeve of his shirt, he invited her to
be seated. Brother Green was welding some iron, and
Olive waited until the operation was concluded and
the plough-hook made before she talked to him. Meanwhile
she watched with interest the white glowing
fire and the pulpy white-hot iron-bar, helplessly bending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>over at the end like a piece of half boiled molasses
candy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I felt so lonesome, I thought I would come out
and talk to someone,” she said, by way of excuse for
a first visit. “Diana isn’t a bit of company when you
feel really lonesome. Ezra is gone for four days, did
you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Diana had cocked one ear at the mention of her
name, but had speedily uncocked it again on becoming
satisfied that nothing in the way of excitement
was at hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I suppose you do feel lonely,” said Brother
Green slowly, as he seated himself on his anvil and
crossed his brawny arms. “I’ve been used to it for so
long, I have almost forgotten how anything else feels.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive looked kindly at him. “Are you ever homesick,
and do you ever wish you had stayed in England?
It must be very different from here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very,” said Brother Green gazing with a far-away
sort of look through the large forge door out
over the shimmering prairie. He suddenly seemed to
see rolling hills with oak woods tufting their slopes,
and a deep valley, where blue curling smoke ascended
in high spirals, and a church steeple rose from among
elms, and jackdaws croaked around the steeple. He
put his head a little on one side, almost as if he would
catch more distinctly the hoarse croak of the jackdaws,
or maybe the first sound of the bell which hung in
the steeple and used to ring on Sundays.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Yes,” he said, as this picture faded away and
the prairie returned in its place, “there can’t be much
greater differences in the world than between Perfection
City and the little village in Sussex, where I was
born.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which do you like best, Brother Green?” asked
Olive a little thoughtlessly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t expect ever to be as unhappy again as I
was in that pretty little village,” said Brother Green,
and Olive remembered that she had been told he had
lost a young wife in his youth. She felt sorry for
him, and regretted having touched upon an old wound
that still could throb with pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you heard any news lately? Has anybody
been to the forge? You are always the first to hear
news,” said she quickly, desiring to change the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A man from down south passed this morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he?” said Olive anxiously, “what did he
say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He said the fire was just bellowing its way towards
Fort Scott, and had done a good deal of damage
one way or another. It was one of the hottest
they ever had and the hardest to stop. It crossed
one of the South Fork Creeks and got into the broken
land round Osage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had a very narrow escape ourselves,” said
Olive, feeling remarkably little interest in the fire.
“Did he say anything else? Who was he?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“A stranger, I never saw him before. No, he
didn’t say anything else, except to tell me that he
calkerlated Britishers were mos’ly fools and couldn’t
do a day’s work ’gain ’Mericans, no matter what it
were, rail-splitting or tobacco-chawin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Green gave a deep gentle laugh, like the
distant boom of a waterfall hidden among trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think these prairie folk are most conceited?”
asked Olive, in some scorn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, not more than other people, Sister,” replied
Brother Green somewhat unexpectedly, “they only
say what they think with remarkable frankness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But that is conceit,” persisted Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not certain that it is more conceited to say
what you think, than to think your thoughts in silence,
and be consumed with a vast contempt for all
the world. We are a conceited people too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought the English prided themselves on not
being conceited,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We pride ourselves on showing no feeling of
conceit and if possible on showing no feeling on any
other subject either. If an Englishman’s heart were
skinned, I think it would weigh up pretty much the
same as an American’s. The difference lies in the
tongue only.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that so?” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, this morning, for instance, that man informed
me that he was a better man than I, and that
his country could lick mine. Well, in my heart I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>knew he was wrong on both points, and that the precise
contrary was the fact. As far as essentials go, I
think we were pretty equal in the contest of conceit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you didn’t tell him what you thought,” remarked
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, that was the difference of tongue, not of
heart,” replied Brother Green.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know you were so severe in your criticisms
and judgments. I wonder much what you really
think of Perfection City,” said Olive, looking at him
curiously. She had never particularly noticed him
hitherto, and had not realized that he could have a
store of knowledge of many things which lay far outside
her experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think Perfection City will do good,” said
Brother Green with conviction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you, and why?” asked Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any honest human effort to benefit the world
and raise mankind does good,” said Brother Green.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But people have done such different things and
all from a desire to do what seemed to them good,”
objected Olive with feminine vagueness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I consider they have done good if their purpose
was single-hearted,” maintained Brother Green.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They didn’t succeed in doing what they aimed
at very often, at all events,” observed Olive, “something
quite different came out of their endeavours
from what they had expected.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Nevertheless, if they honestly tried, then that
very trying was of itself good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think Perfection City will do the good
the Pioneers expect, or will something quite different
come out of it too?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think Perfection City will be the means of
teaching a valuable lesson,” said Brother Green cordially.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think it is any use to try to change the
world and its ideas?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If anyone has a truth let him preach it fearlessly.
Who can foretell the moment when the world will
listen and when it is ready to profit by your example.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive longed to ask him what he thought of Madame,
but dared not do so. She felt a little afraid
before this simple-minded man, with his fervent, childlike
faith and his sad and lonely life. Belief in Perfection
City might be his only comfort now, shut off
as he was from the joys of home and family, she would
do nothing to lessen his belief and make him more
lonely still. For what is more lonely than the heart
out of which a faith has departed never to return?
So she bade him good-bye, and then seeing Aunt
Ruby’s chimney giving off the cheerful smoke of habitation,
she turned her steps thither. Olive walked
slowly along, for it was very hot indeed with a dry
suffocating heat that made exertion somewhat irksome,
and Diana, the discreet, followed dutifully behind
her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Aunt Ruby, as has been already hinted, had surrounded
herself with a large family of chickens of
all ages, to whose wants it was her great duty to attend.
She had a rare hand for chickens, and could
pick up the most spasmodic specimen and turn it upside
down and examine it for the gapes without hurting
it in the least. Her driving of the hens to roost
was an exhibition of the talent of generalship worthy
of a wider field. No screamings nor scurryings, no
rushings madly hither and thither, took place, and
above all no sticks were used in the ceremony: Aunt
Ruby merely took her skirts gently at the side in each
hand, and said “Shoo! Shoo!” in a soothing voice,
while at the same time she slightly oscillated the folds
of her skirt. The hens appeared hypnotized by the
action, and no matter how eagerly they might be pursuing
the afternoon fly, they would at once settle
down into a conversational chuck-a-chu and begin
forthwith to meander towards the hen-roost.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Ruby’s numerous hens and chickens were all
in the yard and around the wood-pile, seeking in an
aimless over-fed fashion after chance insects, when
suddenly, without a moment’s warning, the devil was
upon them according to the gallinaceous imagination.
The devil was possessed of four paws, a most terrifying
bark, and a mouth that seemed to the affrighted birds
to be on the point of devouring each one especially
and individually. The dog flew hither and thither, and
so did the chickens, and so did the tail-feathers.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Diana! Bad dog, down, down!” screamed Olive,
rushing to the rescue, while Aunt Ruby with shrill
cry and a broom-stick appeared in the door-way.
Never before or since did a more tempestuous guest
appear at Aunt Ruby’s house. Full a quarter of an
hour of gentle “shoo-shooings” to the hens, interspersed
with smart whippings to Diana, elapsed before
quiet was restored, and the ladies could even begin
their visit together. Even then there was a sort of
nervous tension on Aunt Ruby’s part, which prevented
her thorough enjoyment of the opportunity for
a gossip. Her attention was distracted by Diana, who
lay with lamb-like docility at Olive’s feet and slept
the sleep of the just.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t keep a dawg roun’ nohow,” said Aunt
Ruby eyeing the delinquent sternly. “I’d mos’ as lief
hev a rattlesnake. I shouldn’t never sleep easy in
my bed won’erin’ an’ won’erin’ what the pesky crittur
’ud do nex’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that Diana is very naughty now, but she
is only a puppy, and she’ll get sense by and bye, and
it is so nice to have something that is your own and
loves you, and doesn’t care for any body else, you
know,” observed Olive somewhat rashly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, I reckon you’ll hev a sight o’ trouble ’long
o’ that dawg ’fore you learn it the rights o’ people,
let alone teachin’ it community idees,” said Aunt
Ruby.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, you can’t teach a dog communistic notions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>thank goodness,” observed Olive, patting the sinful
Diana.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Reckon you ain’t partic’ler sot on the idees of
Perfection City,” said the old lady, looking at her
visitor with bright twinkling eyes. “I allow there
be a p’int or two we’ll hev to consider over agin at
’Sembly. We are gettin’ on too fas’ fur this here
prairie folk, they hain’t got the sense to un’erstan’
all o’ our highest principles. Guess while there’s Injuns
roun’ we hed better jes’ hol’ back a mite ’bout
non-resistance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh,” said Olive, who had never given any attention
to this point, being as indifferent as the wives of
strong men usually are. “I never heard a word about
Indians. Are there any about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not as I hearn on special. But there’s Injuns
and worse nor Injuns in the world, an’ I reckon we’d
better take that p’int up at ’Sembly and see if we
can’t do su’thin’ to make things a bit straight,” said
Aunt Ruby in language that was vaguely enough expressed
to serve in the highest walks of diplomacy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I dare say,” replied Olive carelessly, “some
very excellent reason could be devised to excuse a
departure from any one of the Perfection City principles,
which seem more difficult to manage in practice
than on paper. They are all pretty new, and of
course can’t be expected to be as useful in all the
difficult circumstances of life as principles which have
stood the test of time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Dear me, suz!” exclaimed Aunt Ruby admiringly.
“How gran’ you kin talk! Deal sight finer nor Brother
Wright. Why don’t you hold forth in ’Sembly?
I’d liefer hear you nor any on ’em. I’m jes’ ’bout tired
o’ listenin’ to Brother Wright. Lard! how he do love
to hear his own voice! Hens is jes’ like that too, they’ll
talk an’ talk till you’re mos’ crazy, an’ they hain’t
nothin’ to say, on’y jes’ to cackle an’ hear themselves
talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive agreed with Aunt Ruby, but hardly dared to
express her opinion in all its force. Therefore she
turned the conversation by inquiring had she ever
heard anything about lynch-law and about its being
put into practice in their neighbourhood?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Course I hev, an’ hearn o’ hangin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do Perfection City principles uphold hanging?”
asked Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess not,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No matter if it was for murder?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, I don’t see as we could ever be called upon
to settle that p’int, ’cause no ’Fectionist could ever be
a murderer no how,” said Aunt Ruby.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But suppose an outsider who had shot a man, even
if it was not a real bad murder, came to us for protection,
would they help him, do you think?” asked
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, I never hearn that debated at the ’Sembly,
but I reckon Perfection City don’t lay out to hide
folks as has killed a feller critter. It don’t ’pear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>me as how we was called upon to min’ anyone ’cept
our own selves, an’ we hed best keep clear ’way o’
them sort o’ folks. That’s pretty nigh my ’pinion,
an’ I guess it’s mos’ folks too as hes a mite o’ common
sense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was fain to confess to herself that in all
probability Aunt Ruby did fairly express the collective
opinion of Perfection City. They had only enough
righteousness for themselves, and, like a ship already
short of provisions, could not help another vessel, even
though it might be flying the Union Jack upside down
and showing all the other flags of acute distress recognized
in the naval code of signals. Had Aunt Ruby
heard of anything concerning a horse-thief who was
supposed to be somewhere around, inquired Olive with
a view to eliciting information, but she only elicited
feminine alarms in overwhelming abundance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do tell! Land o’ liberty! Was there horse-thieves
’bout? What a pity Brother Ezry an’ Brother Dummy
was both gone jes’ now: they might meet in ’Sembly
right away an’ discuss the p’int o’ non-resistance an’
buy revolvers next time anyone went to Union Mills.
Horse-thieves was mos’ as bad as Injuns, an’ if it was
lawful an’ right to defen’ yourself ’gainst Injuns as
was ign’rant savages as never hed Christian teachin’,
it couldn’t be wrong to look a’ter your hosses as was
bought an’ paid for by ’Fection City money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Ruby was so convinced and loquacious upon
this subject and upon the aspect of the case as presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to her mind by her terrors, that Olive heartily regretted
her question, and began to try and do away with the
effects of it as far as possible. It was only a vague
report she averred, and Olive herself had not the
slightest idea that there were horse-thieves about.
Upon the strength of this assurance Aunt Ruby, somewhat
comforted, allowed her attention to be engaged
by other topics of conversation. She was much distressed
that she could not persuade her visitor to stay
all the rest of the day and have a real good soul-satisfying
talk, but Olive declared she must go home and
see to her own chickens, an argument that appealed
very strongly to Aunt Ruby’s maternal instincts.</p>

<p class='c010'>A difficulty arose as to how Diana was to be decently
conducted out through the yard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d mos’ as soon hev to conten’ with a roarin’
lion as that pup,” remarked Aunt Ruby as the difficulty
presented itself to her mind in an acute form.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I could get her past without seeing the hens
and chickens she would be all right,” said Olive, who
of course had no whip, regarding meditatively the
dog, who of course had no collar.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, that ’ud do, I guess, sort o’ take her out
o’ the way o’ temptation,” said Aunt Ruby, surveying
Diana with an anxious eye. “I kin give you an ole
caliker skirt o’ mine, an’ you kin tie up her head in
that reg’lar tight, so as she wouldn’t see ne’er a hen
this side o’ Christmas, ’less you took it off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This seemed a hopeful arrangement; so the “caliker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>skirt” was brought, and the misguided Diana,
under the impression that a brand new game was on
foot, allowed her head to be hidden in the folds of the
skirt. Olive then led her to the door, but Diana objected,
not seeing where the joke came in for her;
and as soon as she found that she was ignominiously
tied into the dreadful skirt, her rage was boundless.
In an instant she wrenched herself free from Olive’s
guiding hand. She then commenced a wild career
around the yard backwards, swaying this way and that
in the most ghastly and unlooked-for manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hens and chickens no sooner beheld this portent
than with one universal squawk of horror they
betook themselves to places of safety under the corn-crib
and into the cracks of the wood-pile, whence they
could not again be coaxed for many hours. Diana
meanwhile continued her fearsome course and ere
long came into violent contact with the chicken-tub,
a large receptacle with loose wooden cover where various
sorts of food suitable for fowls were collected together,
first thinned with water and then thickened
into a glutinous mass by intermixture of corn-meal.
Into this tub Diana sat with extreme violence and then
rolled over. Olive caught her as she was emerging
from the chicken-tub and by uncovering her eyes restored
her to reason. Aunt Ruby, speechless with indignation,
and Olive, equally speechless with laughter,
then set to work with two big spoons to scrape the
chicken food from the ground and from the hind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>quarters of the dog. Diana, now at peace with all the
world, wagged her tail benevolently during this process,
and soon specked Olive over with corn-meal, potatoes,
scraps of peelings, and bits of greens, until she
looked as if she had been out in a snow-storm as severe
in character as it was diversified in composition. When
this job was over Aunt Ruby arose and straightened
her old back with a groan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, I guess I would a deal sight sooner hev a
rattlesnake to look a’ter than a dawg,” she observed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive, apologetic, departed along with the unrepentant
Diana, and together they returned homewards.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Olive spent a few quiet hours at home along with
Diana, and then took supper in company with Napoleon
Pompey, whose manners at table were now
all that could be desired. Indeed, the negro in this
connection easily takes a higher polish than might
be expected: he prides himself on being punctilious
in all the forms and phrases of the best white society
he has ever come in contact with, and being highly
imitative, is quickly trained. Given a white boy and
a black boy of similar ages and depths of ignorance,
the black one will more quickly tame into a seemingly
quiet human being, while very frequently the same
vanity which prompts a negro to be over-zealous in the
use of “please” and “thank you” will cause the
white boy to act roughly and assert his independence
by extravagances of rude behaviour. Napoleon Pompey
was magnificently polite to “Mis’ Ollie,” whom he
adored, and for whom he was ready even to work: that
is to make the greatest sacrifice possible to a negro lad
of twelve. He never forgot to carry in wood for her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>or to pick up chips in generous quantity for the
lighting of the afternoon fire, and he collected abundance
of corn-cobs and had them duly dried in the sun
ready at her hand in case she was in sudden want of
a hot fire. When working for Ezra, Napoleon Pompey
reverted to his natural black standard of diligence
and shirked as much as he possibly could, lying down
in fence-corners to sleep like a shiny black lizard when
he should have been stripping corn, but he never
shirked “Mis’ Ollie’s” work. She didn’t scold the
lad, but ruled him by her gentleness and her beauty,
and he fell into meekest subjection to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive always tried to talk with Napoleon Pompey
at meals, even when Ezra was there, being anxious
to make him feel at his ease and happy in their presence;
and to-day being alone with him she thought
she might get some information out of him on the
subject which was weighing so heavily upon her mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Napoleon Pompey, did you ever hear of their
hunting down men on the prairie here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yo’ bet, Mis’ Ollie, I seed darkie what went to
de hangin’ ole man Howard. He done seed him
hoisted over de tree slap up. He told me——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush!” said Olive sternly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The young savage was abashed, he had meant no
harm, but thought some pleasing details “o’ de hangin’,”
which he himself had relished mightily, would
prove equally acceptable to Olive’s taste. She was
disgusted to think that with all her teaching of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>forms and symbols of politeness and gentle manners,
which the young scamp had received with such docility,
she had not really touched his heart at all: he was
just a black savage, still rejoicing in vivid details of
horrors and cruelty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t tell me,” she said sternly, “that it is possible
you could like to see a human being, a fellow
creature, made in God’s image, no matter how guilty
he might be, put to death. It may be necessary,
Napoleon Pompey, sometimes to hang men who have
done wicked things, so as to prevent others from doing
the same, but it is an awful thing, a sad and terrible
sight. You would never wish to see it, Napoleon Pompey,”
said Olive solemnly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It ’ud be bully ter see ’um kickin’ in de air
wid rope roun’ his neck,” said Napoleon Pompey
simply.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive turned white with disgust and left the
kitchen, retiring with Diana to her own little private
room. Napoleon Pompey, conscious of no shortcomings,
cleared away the supper things very handily,
washed the few dishes, set the candles upon the white
deal table, and whistling in the innocence of his
youthful heart went out to “walk roun’” and see
that all was right, and the hen-house fastened up securely
against possible visits from pole-cats, before
he retired to his loft upstairs shortly after sun-down.
Like the chickens, Napoleon Pompey went early to
roost.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Conscious from the all-pervading stillness that the
lad was gone to bed, Ollie returned to the kitchen,
and her heart smote her as she saw two tallow candles
in their tin candle-sticks placed on the table in convenient
position for her to read, if such should be her
wish. Poor Napoleon Pompey! Olive thought compassionately
of what an affectionate boy he was, and
of how it was not his fault if he still had savage
tastes. Indeed, it was rather the fault of everybody
else. His not very remote ancestors were unreclaimed
African savages, and the career of those more immediate
forefathers, whose lot had been cast in slavery
down South, had not had an elevating tendency. It
was wonderful, not that he still had savage tastes, but
that he had got rid of so many of them. She was
sorry that she had not been better able to control her
feelings, and determined forthwith to institute a careful
system of training with a view to leading him to
the higher life by the shortest possible road. Having
settled in her own mind a few of the more important
lines upon which this training was to be conducted,
Olive turned at last to her reading. But she could
not keep her mind on her book, it kept wandering
off in all sorts of directions, and at last took that
of being frightened at the loneliness and stillness of
the house. When so firmly combating the notion
of being afraid to stay in the house during Ezra’s
absence, Olive had not realized how appalling the
stillness would be. In the daytime there were multitudes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>of unregarded sounds, which went to make up
the sum total of the idea of life and fellowship, but
at night these had completely ceased, and she seemed
to hear the stillness with awful intensity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, too there were no shutters to the windows,
which were, of course, open to let in the cool night
air, and the thought suddenly came into Olive’s mind
of how exposed she really was, sitting there in the
light of her candles, plainly to be seen, but unable
to see out. A thought such as this needs but little
time to grow into a veritable feeling of panic. She
glanced at the black gaping windows and stared out
into the measureless blackness beyond. At one moment
she raised her hand to extinguish the candles
and so to hide herself in the dark along with her fears,
but she knew that would only make matters worse.
She would see in her terrified imagination a hundred
glaring eyes peering in through the window. She
got up and walked about the room, trying by a little
movement to throw off the oppressive sense of terror.
Diana suddenly seemed to be interested in something,
and raised her head and sniffed inquiringly, and her
mistress, nervously awake to every sight or sound,
looked anxiously around her and stopped in her uneasy
walk. Diana arose and went to the door, and
being a puppy wagged her tail effusively, then suddenly
remembering that she ought to be a dog, barked
with vehemence. Olive was ready to scream with
nervous terror as she heard a step upon the slanting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>board which led up to the door and a second later
a knock against the resounding wood. She stood
spell-bound, unable to speak or move. Diana ceased
barking, and looked with eager delight for the opening
of the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is I, friends, let me come in,” said a deep
voice which thrilled Olive to the heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>The door opened and Mr. Cotterell entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Cotterell! What are you here for?” gasped
Olive, as he came in and stood in the light, gaunt-eyed
and hollow-cheeked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am flying for my life, Mrs. Weston. The men
are out hunting me down. I have come to ask your
help. Where is your husband?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is gone away to Mapleton.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” said Cotterell, with a sigh that had some
relief in the sound. “Then you will help me, won’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What have you done?” asked Olive, gazing at
him in terror. He was wild-looking and so different
from the charming gentleman she had known before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve shot Jake Mills,” he replied, without any
attempt at dissimulation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean that you’ve murdered him?”
gasped Olive, starting back from him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good God! Mrs. Weston, no. I’ve not murdered
him, although he is dead by my hand. There’s
been a quarrel between us about some land he rented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>from me. He was a very low-bred fellow and violent,
and I despised him, and—well, I said some harsh
things to him about cheating the last time we met.
He swore that he would pay me out. He came to
my cabin the other day. I don’t know how long
ago, it seems a life-time. He was mad with drink
and fury. I told him he was a hound. He whipped
out his revolver and fired at me, but he was too tipsy
to aim straight, his shots went wide of the mark. Well,
I got my shot in, I was not drunk. That is how it was,
Mrs. Weston. Upon my honour as a man, that is the
exact truth, you would not call it murder, would
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it was in self-defence. But why didn’t you
go and tell the neighbours at once? They understand
that sort of thing on the prairie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, there’s just my hard luck. There was a
brute of a negro who saw it all, a fellow I thrashed
once for stealing and lying, and he said with such
a meaning look, niggers were free men now, they
could give evidence against white men now,” said
Cotterell in a voice of despair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Could not you silence him?” said Olive, “or
make him tell the truth?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I could have silenced him easily enough,
and I had my finger on the trigger to do it. But
I sickened at the thought. I couldn’t shoot him,
although it was my life against his in all probability.
I fled and he gave the alarm. I have no chance with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>these men around here to try me, and that negro
to give his lying version of the fight. If it was a jury
of men like your husband, it would be different, but
these ignorant settlers are desperately prejudiced
against me already as a foreigner, and because of several
things in the past.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive thought of what her husband had said, and
knew only too well that there was indeed much prejudice
against the unhappy fugitive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What am I to do? You cannot stay here, Mr.
Cotterell. They have already been looking for you.
Mr. Owen was here yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he tell you what I had done? Did he seem
to consider it murder?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, he did,” said Olive in a whisper, not daring
to remember what he had said should he Cotterell’s
punishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you don’t look upon it in that light?” said
he, wistfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, certainly not. It was a terrible misfortune
that might happen to anybody, given the preliminary
quarrel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” said Cotterell brokenly. “When
a poor devil is being hunted down it is a comfort
for him to find someone who can still believe in
him, and I knew in my heart I could come to you
for help when all else had abandoned me. I am
starving, Mrs. Weston. I have eaten nothing for two
days. Can you give me some food?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“Poor fellow!” cried Olive, more struck perhaps
by his bodily needs than by those of the mind. “Sit
down here, I’ll get you something in a jiffy. There
is a good chicken-pie in the cellar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She took a lantern and hurried off to the cellar
which was under the house, but to which entrance
was effected by an outside door. She brought him
food and drink and sat by him as he ate ravenously,
wolfishly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must sleep or I shall never be able to hold
out for the flight to-morrow. Let me lie here, will
you, and wake me at mid-night. Will you do that
for me? I must sleep. I have been hiding in the
bottom-land of Cotton Wood Creek in the brushwood
ever since I left home. I didn’t dare to ride
across the prairie with everybody out on account of
the fire. I should have been seen by someone, even
if I could have got clear of the fire. The hunt must
be over now on this side of the county, and I may
dare snatch a little sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He flung himself down on the floor, and almost
before Olive could fetch a pillow for his head he
was in a deep sleep. She sat watching him and wondering
what his life was. Somewhere away in England,
perhaps, there was a blue-eyed girl waiting for
him to come home, a girl whose blue eyes were getting
dim with the tears she shed in that long, long
waiting. He was a very handsome man, with his yellow
moustache and clear-cut features. His hat was off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>leaving a sort of high-water mark plainly visible on
his forehead, where the sun-burn ended and the
smooth white skin showed upon his temples. The
veins were marked in blue like a baby’s, she remembered
how Ezra had commented on these blue veins.
She wondered who he was and why he came there to
live, and all the while she watched the slow rise and
fall of his chest as he breathed in his sleep with his
right hand nervelessly holding his revolver. How he
would start up and grip that weapon, and how his
blue eyes would flash, if his pursuers should come
upon him! He was a man that had a reputation for
bravery even on the prairie, where few men were
cowards. She thought of Prince Charlie and his
wanderings, and all the stories she had read as a girl
about that charming prince. Here was a fugitive
seeking her aid, and she—well, she would act the
part of Flora Macdonald. By the time it was mid-night,
Olive had worked herself into a most romantic
frame of mind and was determined to help Mr.
Cotterell at every hazard. She was not a person
to do a thing by halves. She made a parcel of
food for him out of the remains of the chicken-pie,
and then, it being just mid-night, she awoke
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, Mrs. Weston, how can I ever show my gratitude
to you? You are in veriest truth my guardian
angel. I shall carry your image in my heart till I
die,” said Cotterell in his soft persuasive voice. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>should like to think that you had some memory of
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not forget you, and shall pray that you
may escape all dangers,” said Olive gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have absolutely nothing that I can call my
own. Would you accept this ring of mine as a token
of my gratitude, and sometimes wear it in memory
of me? When you look at it, think that somewhere
in this weary world there is one heart that will be
grateful to you until it ceases to beat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He pulled a ring from his finger and put it into her
hand. At the same time he stooped his tall form and
softly kissed her forehead, saying: “God bless you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive’s eyes were full of tears. “You must be
going or it will be too late,” she said with a sob.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I must not tarry.” He looked to his revolver,
jerked his cartridge-case round into a more
convenient position for rapidly opening it, and took
up his hat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is your horse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hitched him to the bars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will take the lantern and light you on
your way. The night is very dark. Once on horseback
you can ride by the light of the stars,” said
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I’ll shape my course for the Missouri border,
if I can run the gauntlet of the people here. Once
I reach a town and civilization I shall be all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They went to the bars, Olive holding her little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>lantern which threw a feeble ray along the pathway.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great God!” cried Cotterell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, what is it? Are they coming after you?”
said Olive in alarm, dropping her lantern which instantly
went out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My horse is gone!” said Cotterell, whose eyes
were now becoming accustomed to the darkness. “I
left him hitched here. He was a wild young colt,
not half broken. See, this is the lariat-rope wrenched
in two. I was a fool to trust to that rope, and a double-dyed
fool to leave him here in the dark. But I was
too hungry and too sleepy to think clearly of what
I was doing. That sleep will cost me my life. I
shall have plenty of time to sleep, aye forever, if daylight
catches me here. Mrs. Weston will you add one
more benefit to the many that have gone before?
Will you give me a horse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, so gladly if I had one,” said Olive, beginning
to cry with grief and helplessness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Haven’t you any horses?” asked Cotterell with
a gasp.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. Ezra and Brother Huntley have taken two
teams to Mapleton.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are there no more about the place?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only our two that were out on the prairie.
Brother Wright was to hunt for them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he find them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. Perhaps he did.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Then you must give me one of them. They
are yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are not mine. Oh, I have not anything
in this dreadful Community. It is horrible,” wailed
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t, pray don’t,” said Cotterell feeling for her
hand in the darkness and crushing it in a passionate
grasp. “Come with me and help me get one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! steal one of our horses?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, God help me! if that must be the word.
If I live, the Community shall have the horse’s price
ten times over. If I am hanged, put it down for
the Recording Angel’s tears. Come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The horses are not here. They are at Brother
Wright’s if anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you find the way in the dark? Then come
all the same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He held her hand. Was it for fear lest she should
turn back, or was it for some other reason? They
walked in silence towards the Wrights’ house, two
dark shadows stealing through the blackness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Cotterell,” whispered Olive with chattering
teeth. “If anyone should come out of the house
on account of the noise, don’t fire. We are all non-resistants,
you know, here, and he won’t have a pistol.”
Olive had no knowledge of the plenary indulgence
which Brother Wright had seen fit to bestow upon
himself in this matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear heart! don’t fear,” said Cotterell tenderly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“I am a desperate man flying for his life, it is true,
but I am not a dastard. No human being at Perfection
City shall ever be hurt by my hand. They
are all sacred to me for your sweet sake. Ah yes, how
truly it is Perfection City, none but I really know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They walked on again in silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is there a dog?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but he knows me well. We are coming to
the back of the stable now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then go and speak to the dog through the
chinks of the logs, else he will bark at me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive crept up quietly, and putting her lips to a
crevice in the rough log-stable said softly, “Pluto,
good dog!” Pluto answered with a whine of satisfaction,
and a soft, purring trumpet from Queen
Katharine announced that she too was within, and
that she recognised her mistress’s voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The horses are here,” whispered Olive. “I will
go round and bring out Queen Katharine; there is
only a wooden bolt on the outside to fasten the door.
You had better not go near them for fear of exciting
them, which might make the dog bark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is dangerous for you in the dark. I fear the
horses may hurt you,” said Cotterell, slow in bringing
himself to give up the little hand he had held all
during that strange night walk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not afraid of the horses: they know me
and I know them,” said Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cotterell heard her talking softly to Queen Katharine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>as she quietly undid her halter and brought her
out of the stable. Not a creature seemed awake in
the house, and not a word was spoken by the two as
they stole past down to the bars. Once out of earshot,
Cotterell sprang upon Queen Katharine and
stooping down lifted Olive up before him. She never
could quite remember the wild things he said as he
rode back to their house, holding her in his arms on
the horse. She was dizzy, frightened, and confused,
so perhaps he did not say all those wild words, and
perhaps she dreamed them. He got Ezra’s saddle
and put it on Queen Katharine, Olive did not forget
to give him the parcel of food and a flask of milk and
water, and then he said good-bye. Such a strange
good-bye. He knelt before her, clasped her two
hands in his own, and said: “Now I know why men
have worshipped the image of pure womanhood. It
made them better. I shall be made a better man by
my worship.” And then he was gone without another
word, and Olive crept into the house just as the first
grey streaks of dawn appeared.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>When Brother Wright early next morning discovered
the loss of the brown mare, he was thrown into
a state of the most unphilosophic rage. He had not
a moment’s doubt as to what had happened, nor a
moment’s hesitation as to the course he should pursue.
He hurried back to the house and without any
effort at concealment got out his revolver and stuck
it into his belt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wright,” said Mary, his wife, “whatever have
you got there?” She was filled with amazement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A pistol,” replied he with firmness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you going to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shoot a damned horse-thief, who has been and
broken into the stable and stolen Queen Katharine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He jammed down his hat on his head and made
for the door, while Mary Winkle gave a scream that
would have done credit to the finest lady in the land.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shan’t do any such thing! You will be
killed! What do you know about pistols? You will
be shot by those murderous horse-thieves, and what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>will become of me—and Willette?” Mary Winkle
urged the very arguments that have before now been
known to make brave men falter and turn back from
running risks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I shan’t do anything rash,” said Wright sheepishly.
“I’ll just go round and rouse the neighbours
and see if we can’t catch him, he can’t have got very
far as yet. What beats me is why Pluto didn’t bark.
The dog’s a fool, I’ll drown him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I am thankful he didn’t bark, for you might
have been dead by now if he had. You shan’t drown
him, for he has saved your life. Horse-thieves are
desperate men and wouldn’t respect our principles of
non-resistance,” said Mary Winkle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ahem,” said her husband, tucking the revolver
out of sight until required.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What we’ve got to do is to go to Madame and
summon an Assembly of Urgency and talk this matter
over, and see what the Community is to do. Wright,
you can’t go and rouse the neighbours till you’ve got
the sanction of the Assembly. You know that is the
rule in all important matters, and this is about the
most important matter that has ever come up for discussion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Damn discussion!” said Wright angrily. “While
we’re discussing that thief will get away. Sharp is
the word for catching horse-thieves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But sharp is not the word for determining the
action of Perfection City in an important juncture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>like the present. Wright, I am surprised at
you, and also at your language,” said his wife severely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh these infernal horse-thieves would provoke a
saint,—not that I am one,” said Wright, still in a rage
most unbecoming to a professed non-resistant, and
Mary Winkle looked a whole essay full of rebuke at
him. She carried the day, however, and together
they carried their complaint to Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>They found Madame sitting at breakfast along
with Uncle David, and being waited upon by a negro-servant,
Lucinda, the mother of Napoleon Pompey.
The heat of a cooking-stove made Madame ill, therefore
she required a servant, and she had what she
required, principles of equality to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear, dear!” exclaimed Uncle David in much
excitement and perturbation. “Wal, to think now
o’ what big raskills there is in the worl’, an’ we a-settin’
’em such a good ’xample here o’ honesty an’ uprightness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must summon the Assembly,” said Mary
Winkle firmly. “It is a great pity Brothers Ezra and
Dummy are both away, but there are quite enough
left to deliberate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you think that is the best plan, we had better
do it at once, there should be no time wasted,”
said Madame, looking interrogatively at Brother
Wright’s frowning face.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“If you ask me——” he began when his wife interrupted
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We don’t ask you, Wright, at least not until
the Assembly of Urgency is convened. Your vote
doesn’t count for more than mine, and I demand an
Assembly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wright shrugged his shoulders, and Madame
smiled a little sarcastically. “We will summon it,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ I’ll jes’ step roun’ an’ fetch Sister Olive,”
said Uncle David, putting on his hat as he spoke, “an’
you can bring together the rest of the brethren.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They came quickly enough when they heard of
the loss of the brown mare, only Olive was absent.
She was ill in bed with a headache and spoke to
Uncle David out of a darkened room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Wright detailed the loss of the horse,
while the Assembly listened in deepest attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What we have to consider is the best means of
recovering the horse if possible,” said Madame. “Does
anyone know what is usually done under similar circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The neighbours join together and run down the
thief as quickly as possible,” said Brother Wright,
with sharp emphasis.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And having run him down, hang him,” added
Mary Winkle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That course is impossible for us,” observed
Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“That is a point I should like to debate,” said
Brother Wright. “If we are to live here we must
have horses, and we can’t keep horses if it is known
to be against our principles to shoot a horse-thief.
That is all I’ve got to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ I want to notice the p’int o’ Injuns,” said
Aunt Ruby. “Ef there’s Injuns as will do any
wickedness un’er the sun, I want to know are we to
sit still an’ be roasted on our own fires by wile savages
like that, or will the men-folks defen’ us as other men
do? An’ I likewise would wish to p’int out to the
’Sembly as border ruffians is mos’ly as bad as Injuns,
an’ it stan’s to reason as horse-thieves is ’bout the
same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me,” said Brother Green, speaking
with great deliberation, “that our principles were
formed and adopted because we thought them right.
I don’t see in what we should differ from anybody
else if we took to the usual prairie arms the moment
we felt the shoe pinch! If non-resistance is right,
it should be practised against horse-thieves; if it is
wrong, then we should be prepared to shoot the
thieves of other men’s horses. There is no middle
course. The throwing away of our settled convictions
just because our horse has been stolen is not
consistent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll vote for non-resistance and the maintenance
of our principles,” said Mary Winkle severely,
“and I further think that what is decided by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>majority in this meeting should bind all the members.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She fixed her eye upon Wright with meaning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a most difficult juncture,” remarked Madame.
“I wish much we had the help of Brother
Ezra’s wisdom to guide us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Uncle David cordially, “an’ sister
Olive too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not see how Sister Olive can have any experience
that would enable her to give good advice
on this subject,” said Madame acidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Sister Olive has consider’ble ’cuteness,” remarked
Uncle David. “Now you’d be ’stonished to
hear the wise things she says, an’ she as purty as a
kitten or a rose all the while.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I guess we’ll just do nothing at all? Is
that the decision of this Assembly?” asked Brother
Wright abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is great force in passive resistance,” said
Brother Carpenter, a boneless individual who counted
for little either for work in the fields, or for advice
in the councils, of Perfection City. “Where passive
resistance has been applied by large numbers and for
a long time it has effected great changes,” he observed
conversationally.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think principles are principles,” said Brother
Green, “and may not be lightly set aside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I guess I’ll go home then, since nothing
is going to be done,” said Brother Wright angrily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“and I’ll try and keep hold of the last horse, else
that thief will come and take him too, when he finds
what fools he’s got to deal with.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Assembly broke up, having decided nothing
at all, and having only succeeded in embittering the
feelings of several persons, and in widening the chasm
of differences which had revealed itself in the course
of the debate, a result that has often followed the
meeting of larger and more notorious Assemblies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although Brother Wright could not now violate
one of the fundamental doctrines of Perfection City,
it was open to him to use a little worldly wisdom
in the way of setting others upon the track of the
thief. Accordingly, without saying a single word
to Mary Winkle or anyone else, he mounted Rebel
and proceeded to rouse the neighbours who were not
at all bound by non-resistant theories. Nothing gets
up a prairie man’s anger quicker than the knowledge
that a horse-thief has begun active operations in his
vicinity. Horses are absolutely necessary to his daily
life, and to be suddenly deprived of his horses is one
of the greatest calamities that can overtake a settler.
They can take a merciful view of homicide at times,
but never of horse-stealing. Brother Wright relied
on this known propensity, and by visiting the most
hardy of his neighbours had before night started as
relentless a set of hunters after Queen Katharine as
ever put leg over horse or drew pistol from belt.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive meanwhile remained at home all unconscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of what had taken place at the Assembly, and of the
pursuit organized afterwards as the effect of Brother
Wright’s embassies. She had decided in her own mind
that the best course for her to adopt was to keep absolute
silence until Ezra should come home. To him
she would explain everything, and she felt convinced
that he was just enough, albeit no friend of Cotterell’s,
to be ready to sacrifice a horse in order to
facilitate his escape. She did not feel at all so sure
about some of the other members of the Community.
At all events Cotterell’s best chance of safety lay in
her keeping firmly to her resolution of silence about
him. The best way for her to keep silent without exciting
suspicion was not to talk with anyone, and feeling
pretty well convinced that somebody would come
to talk over the great calamity with her, she resolved
to be out of the way. In any case she was very miserable
and very anxious, and could not stay at home,
so she wandered off for a walk. She went to the
spring, then she went to Weddell’s Gully and looked
at the black burnt waste. She tried to think about
the interest and excitement of the fire, but could think
of nothing but Cotterell riding for his life and of
the men who were riding after him. Olive knew
nothing of the second set of men sent after the horse-thief;
her mind was still anxiously dwelling on the
probability of his being captured by those who had
“wanted” him for the murder of Jake Mills. The fact
was, however, that this first hunting-party had given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>over their quest, for a man must be caught by the
second day on the prairie if he is to be caught at all.
This, however, Olive did not know, and she kept wondering
and picturing all sorts of terrible possibilities.
Had the men found the trail? Would Queen Katharine
hold out till he got to the border? True she
had been resting for a whole day, but then a man’s
life depended on her endurance, and Olive remembered
with a cold dread that Queen Katharine was
only a farm-horse and not trained to such desperate
efforts as this. Then she remembered the others, those
dreadful hunters, were also mounted on farm horses,
and this thought gave her some small comfort. She
came home again after a most wretched day spent
in aimless rambling over the hopeless black prairie
and crept up to the outside platform to scan once
more that dreary waste towards the endless western
horizon. Far away towards the north-west she saw
a band of horsemen huddled together and moving
rapidly in an easterly direction. Olive’s heart stood
still with terror. Oh! who were they? And why
were they riding rapidly? Men rode in bands to
funerals, but then they went slowly: they rode fast
only when out on a man-hunt. She did not call up
Napoleon Pompey, although he could see like a hawk;
she dreaded to hear what his explanation would be.
She watched with straining eyes until the men had
disappeared within the belt of timber that marked
the course of the Creek, then she came downstairs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>with her miserable discovery hidden in her
heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next day dragged slowly by, Olive feeling
more and more wretched and anxious each moment,
and longing for Ezra’s return. Napoleon Pompey
did nothing but speculate about the horse-thief and
the probabilities of his capture. He regaled Olive
with accounts of the numbers of men out on the hunt,
the desperate character of their courage, and the murderous
accuracy of their aim with revolvers. Sick at
heart she had to listen to him and try and collect her
terrified senses in order to make occasional comments
and replies. Again she hid herself away from her
neighbours and spent most of the day in a corn-stack,
not two hundred yards from the house, whence she
could see plainly without being seen. Uncle David
came and stayed so long waiting for her, that she
nearly smothered in the corn-stack before he went
away, and she was able to come out and catch a breath
of fresh air. Then Aunt Ruby came and peered all
about everywhere, even down into the cellar, and
stayed a good while there examining Olive’s milkpans,
until Olive bethought herself of the device of
sending off Diana to hasten Aunt Ruby’s exit from
the cellar. This device succeeded: Aunt Ruby was
so dismayed at seeing that redoubtable puppy lolloping
up to her that she incontinently fled, and Olive
emerged once more from the suffocation of the corn-stack.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Mary Winkle came twice, fortunately without
Willette, for that astute young person would instantly
have discovered Olive, owing to the pertinacious company
of Diana. A dog does not hang around a corn-stack
the live-long day unless there is something interesting
inside it claiming attention. Olive began
to feel like a hunted criminal herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Napoleon Pompey had been sent away in the morning
to look for some young cattle that had not been
seen since the fire, and having to go on foot he did not
come back till the afternoon. He burst in upon her
with these appalling words:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dey’s done cotch him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who told you?” asked Olive, not pretending
any miscomprehension of what was only too plain to
her mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ole nigger seed ’em. Dey bringin’ him back.
Ole man Cotterell he de hoss-thief, him ridin’ Queen
Katharine when dey cotch him. Nigger tole me he
seed ’em yonder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have they shot him?” asked Olive with white
lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dey’s gwine ter jury-try him, den dey hang
him ’cause he done stole hoss and he kill ole Mill’s
Jake.” Napoleon Pompey licked his lips and grinned.
Olive turned from him in horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where have they taken him to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dunno. Nigger he ’lowed dey gwine ter Jacksonville.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Olive made up her mind and took her resolution.
She questioned Napoleon Pompey very carefully,
found exactly what negro it was from whom he had
obtained his information concerning the capture of
Cotterell. He worked with the Halls who lived over
the other side of Cotton Wood Creek, and she made
minute inquiries as to how to reach their house. Then
she told the boy to give Rebel a double feed of corn
and to bring in the new lariat-rope and mallet and
pin. Rebel had been removed back to his own stable
by Brother Wright’s desire, as he had no belief now
in Pluto as a watch-dog. Napoleon Pompey was open-mouthed
with wonder at Olive’s directions about the
horse, and asked “whar she gwine?” She told him
to do as she bid him and to say nothing to anybody
about it, whereat he was still more open-mouthed.
Olive got a large shawl and rolled it up into a tight
bundle, and then dressed herself in a strong serviceable
stuff dress and went to supper with Napoleon Pompey,
to whom she never spoke a single word. When supper
was over she sent him down to his mother to ask
her to bake a pumpkin-pie for her. Napoleon Pompey
said he would go “fust thing in de mornin’,” and
she told him sternly to go at once and do as he was
bid. When Napoleon Pompey came back Olive was
gone, and so was Rebel, with lariat-rope picket-pin
and mallet, and so was her tightly rolled shawl.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perfection City had further cause for amazement
and hurried meeting in Assembly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Olive, meanwhile, was riding fast towards Cotton
Wood Creek which she reached and crossed by the
last shreds of daylight. She stumbled up out of the
bottom-lands on to the high prairie, then perceiving by
the sound of Rebel’s hoofs that at last she had struck
grass again, for the fire had not crossed the Creek,
she determined to camp. It was a black night, but
she knew how to drive her picket and unsaddle her
horse blindfold. Taking her saddle and shawl out of
the circle of Rebel’s night-range, she wrapped herself
up to wait until daylight should permit her again to
go forward. She was not in the least frightened, although
the prairie wolves were yelping in the distance.
The nervous terrors that had beset her when sitting
in her own comfortable little kitchen with her dog
at her feet, and a stout lad in the room overhead,
were quite gone. Yet there was enough to frighten
a more valiant person than our poor little Olive,
with her half-defined thoughts and her generous impulses.</p>

<p class='c010'>What was it she proposed to herself in this expedition?
First of all to overtake Cotterell and his
captors, and then to do what the wit of woman could
devise to save him from their fury. In her ignorance
of prairie feelings and ideas she attached no importance
to the fact that he would have been captured
riding the well-known brown mare belonging to Perfection
City. He would of course explain that she had
lent him the animal, and that question would at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>drop out of the debate. Then the terrible one of the
shooting of Jake Mills would have to be settled. That
was what she feared for Cotterell, and that was where
her testimony and pleading might avail. She knew
from his own lips how the fatal affray had occurred,
and she would be able in some measure, perhaps, to
counteract the evidence of that wicked lying negro
who out of revenge was going to swear away Cotterell’s
life. Olive hated to do it, but she knew she could
say things to any western jury that would make it
difficult for them to admit negro evidence. For once
in a way the mighty race-prejudice could be relied
upon to work for justice, and poor Olive, fanatical
friend of the negro, had to confess she was glad to
have so strong a lever to her hand in this dreadful
emergency.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile the never-ending night wore on. How
long, how unutterably long are the hours of darkness
to them who wait sleeplessly for the dawn! The
twinkling stars passed over her head, and Olive tried
to fix her eyes steadily on one or two of them in order
to convince herself that they really did move after all.
Thus staring at the stars, her eyes became weary, and
the lids dropped slowly over them, and she fell into a
troubled sleep, haunted with fearsome visions.</p>

<p class='c010'>She must have slept some little time, for when she
awoke the stars had certainly changed places and
were moreover becoming pale in the first grey streaks
of morning. Olive awoke shivering with cold and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>drenched with the heavy prairie dew. Her teeth chattered,
so she could hear them like a piece of broken
machinery moving inside her head, while her fingers
were almost numb. As soon as she could make out
Rebel in the approaching dawn, she saddled him, and,
woman-like, did not forget the lariat-rope, picket-pin
and mallet, even in the midst of her terrible anxiety.
She thought of Cotterell in the hands of his foes, and
the recollection came back to her, like a blow that
almost stunned her, that this would be the last time
he would ever see the sun rise unless she hurried to
his rescue. The thought spurred her to renewed activity,
the horror of it drove the chilled blood with a
rush to her heart. She caught her breath, and then
felt hot. She did not shiver any more, and her chattering
teeth were set in a desperate resolve. She
clambered up on the horse’s back and set off at a gallop
towards that house where she would get positive
news which would help her to find the lynching-party
quickly. Ah! merciful God! The lynching-party!
She urged Rebel into a harder gallop, for the sun was
just beginning to appear over the horizon, and she
could see where she was going. She reached the
cabin where the Halls lived in due course. They didn’t
know her, but they invited her to breakfast with prairie
courtesy. She saw the negro man who had told
the news to Napoleon Pompey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, he seed ’em totin’ ole man Cotterell back.”
There was never any doubt in Olive’s mind as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>fact that they had caught him, what she wanted to
know was the destination of the party. “He ’lowed
dey was gwine ter Jacksonville, ’cause down yonder
was whar dey hang de las’ man; den dey jury-try
him, an’ Jacksonville mighty handy anyhow, dar heaps
o’ trees dar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive could not repress a shudder of horror which
the negro saw, and so did the Halls. She would not
stop a moment to eat a bit of breakfast, notwithstanding
their urgent entreaties, but got directions as to
the shortest road to Jacksonville and hastened away
on her errand of mercy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Hall looking after her rapidly vanishing figure,
and remembering the look of misery on her face,
“reckoned ’twas one o’ them po’ silly gals as is cotched
by a yaller ’stache. She was powerful sorry for her
anyhow, she ’peared mos’ broke down an’ sick. She
’lowed if the boys hed hung ole man Cotterell when
Glover’s gal shot herself ’cause he wouldn’t marry her,
’twould hev been a sight better anyhow.” Her husband
was of opinion that “gals was fules gapin’ a’ter
strangers an’ furrin fellers, not bein’ content along o’
their nat’ral men-folks as b’longed to ’em, app’inted
by the hand o’ Providence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive rode through the hot September day feeling
very faint and tired, but never for a moment faltering
in her determination; and well on in the afternoon
she came to Jacksonville, a place with two houses
standing and the stakes for three more stuck into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>ground to signify possession. There was only one
woman in the place along with a flock of children.
No sign of men anywhere. The woman did not know
much about the movements of the “boys.” “They
hadn’t passed that way at all, but she hearn tell they
had been out catching a horse-thief and murderer, and
they had caught him too, a Britisher, she was told,
and it was a shame those foreigners should be allowed
to come to America to steal honest folks horses, and
true born Americans too, as always worked for every
cent before they spent it. They had taken him to
Union Mills to try him and she hoped—well she didn’t
want to say anything unbecoming to a professing
Christian, but wouldn’t Olive come in and eat a bit
and rest before going further, she didn’t look fit for
such hard riding.” Olive, feeling sick with disappointment,
accepted a morsel of food, and asking her
way to Union Mills started off. She had come thirty-eight
miles already, and if she had only known where
to go she would have been there hours ago. It was
nearly twenty miles to Union Mills, she could not
hope to reach it that night, but she started nevertheless
although the sun was getting low in the west.
The horrid thought kept pressing against her heart:
was she already too late? But no, she would force
it out of her mind, and come what might she would
never stop until she had done her utmost to save him.
She therefore pressed forward, but Rebel showed signs
of giving out. He lay down with her suddenly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>tried to roll. This would never do. All depended on
her horse, if he failed her then Cotterell’s last chance
of life was gone. She rode slowly, now following a
prairie track and now riding along side it, because
Rebel stumbled in the ruts. It got dark, she did not
know where she was, but followed the track for some
time mechanically. A light suddenly showed up on
her left. Rebel pricked up his ears and turned towards
it. After some difficulty she reached the door. Could
they harbour her for the night? She was caught out
and could go no further.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Land o’ Goshen! ’course they could, an’ whar
in sin was she gwine that time o’ night ’thout nobody,
not even a dawg?” Olive said it was a case of life
and death and she must do it. They were deeply
sorry, they fed her with corn-bread and bacon, they
fed her horse, and were kindness itself. The cabin
had only one room with a bed in one corner for the
man and his wife. Olive was desperately tired. The
wife said “she’d be doggauned sick ’less she went to
bed.” So Olive lay down on the bed, and the settler’s
wife lay down beside her, and the man slept on the
floor with his head on a pile of corn-shucks. Long
before daylight he went out and fed her horse. The
wife cooked a good breakfast and pressed Olive again
and again “to scrouge down suthin’ more,” and sent
her off with many good wishes as to her finding her
husband better, who, she was sure, ’ud be tickled to
death at seeing her.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>LYNCH-LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Union Mills was full of people, mostly men, and
Phillipps’ Store, which was the only shop in the place,
as well as being the Post-Office, was crowded to suffocation.
Those who couldn’t get inside stood around
the door talking loudly as they chewed their tobacco.
Inside the talking and tobacco-chewing were carried
on likewise. A ring of men were sitting on barrels
and nail-kegs and coils of rope and extemporized chairs
of all kinds. Of these, twelve arranged together at
one side formed the jury, and the rest were witnesses
and spectators. In their midst stood Cotterell. He
was not bound or specially guarded in any way, but
he was unarmed, while pistols hung at the belts of all
the other men there. Cotterell held his head erect,
his eyes looked clear, and his lips were firm. A careful
observer might have noticed that his nostrils sometimes
twitched, but his hands were perfectly steady.
Yet he was on trial for his life, without appeal and
without a friend in “the court.” Several of the men
had asked him questions which he had answered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>shortly and sharply perhaps, but with a perfectly steady
voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I dunno what we’re gwine on talkin’ for,” said
a jury man with a twang that bespoke Arkansas.
“Hain’t it clar this hyar feller, what was wanted for
the shootin’ o’ Ole Mills’ boy, he’s the same cuss as
stole the mare from them damned fools up to ’Fection
City? He’s got ter be hanged, anyhow. I want ter
go home. I hain’t a-gwine to stick hyar all day, by
Gosh!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not steal the mare,” said Cotterell, his nostrils
dilating.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You hear that,” said the foreman, who sat on a
sugar-barrel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You was ridin’ her when we come up t’yer,”
said one who had been out on the hunt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How’d yer git her then ’cept by stealin’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was lent to me by one of the members of
the Community,” said Cotterell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’s damn fools, I know, but I reckon they
hain’t such all-fired damn fools as ter give their best
hoss ter you,” said the man from Arkansas.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cotterell’s lips curled with contempt, but he did
not speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look hyar, fellow jury-men,” said one of them
who prided himself on the accuracy of his language
on all occasions. “I’d axe leave ter make a few remarks.
We were informed by the gentlemen what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>caught the prisoner that they were notified o’ the
stealing by one o’ them Perfection City fellers. If
the horse was lent how is it the owner didn’t know
about the lending?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said one of the gentlemen referred to,
“ole man Wright, he come and tol’ me ’bout the stealin’
o’ the hoss, an’ he ’lowed, on’y it was agin his principles,
he’d like ter hev been out with the boys. It
don’t ’pear ter my min’ as there was much len’ing
’bout it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This trial, gen’lemen, is all fair and square an’
’cordin’ to law. We’ll settle this p’int ’fore we go
further,” said the foreman. “You say the horse was
lent to you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do say so emphatically,” replied the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, we’ve got one o’ them ’Fection City fellers
to say the hoss was stolen, he’ll swear to that, an’ I
reckon by their idees he was part-owner of it anyhow.
Now, that’s the witness agin yer. Who have you got
to swear yer was lent the horse fair and square?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have had no chance of getting any witness, as
you very well know,” replied Cotterell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, I reckon yo’ hev bin kep’ purty toler’ble
close. Anyhow, it shan’t be said as we hain’t gi’en yer
a good chance. Now, which might be yer witness to
the len’ing? There hain’t such a damn sight o’ folks
up to ’Fection City as ’ud make yer forget so ready
as all that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Cotterell hesitated.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“Hain’t yo’ got no tongue? Who lent yer the
hoss, I say?” repeated the foreman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Weston,” said Cotterell at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s a lie, anyhow,” burst out one of the bystanders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not a lie, it is the truth,” said Cotterell
hotly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, now, see hyar. I was over to ole man Weston’s,
an’ I seed Mis’ Weston myself, an’ she tole me
she hadn’t sot eyes on yer. Now then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Owen who spoke, he had been out, as we
know, on the first hunting-party and was now present
as a spectator. He would have been on the jury, only
it was considered more delicate for him to stand aside,
considering that he had been out to catch Cotterell,
and prairie men are punctilious in the observance of
all those forms of etiquette with which they are familiar.
Although not on the jury, Owen was quite free
to intervene in the trial, he was one of the foremost
settlers on the prairie. Cotterell looked hard at him
as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did she tell you that herself?” he asked, drawing
his eyebrows tightly together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, she tole me herself,” replied Owen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I have nothing further to say,” said Cotterell,
setting his teeth grimly under his moustache.
He realised very clearly what he was doing, he was
throwing away his last chance of life; but his resolution
never wavered for a moment. The thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>flashed through his mind that most people would
think him a fool to act as he did, risk the certainty
of death for the sake of a fantastic loyalty to a woman
who could never be to him anything but the distant
friend another man’s wife should be. Then came the
recollection that no one, not even she for whom he
was sacrificing his life, would ever know what he had
done. There was something fantastic surely in all
this. Their whole acquaintance had been fantastic
in a sense: Mr. Perseus was a fancy, but how dangerously
sweet it had been while it lasted. And now it
was over, he would never hear the sound of her voice
again nor feel the touch of her little hand. Poor
child! He could well imagine, with that jealous husband
of hers, how she might have been driven to save
herself from his anger by declaring she had never seen
him. Jealousy was a monster surely, if there ever
was a monster on this earth. Cotterell almost smiled
to himself as he thought how once again he would
act the part of Perseus to the unhappy one and save
her by his silence from the monster’s fangs. Thoughts
such as these swept through his mind as he stood facing
the jury, while they were somewhat nonplussed
as to their future proceedings owing to his determination
not to say anything further. It appeared almost
indecent to hang a man who would not argue out the
points with them: they had never met such a one
before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s a gal hyar a-wantin’ ter come in,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>one of the men who was standing just outside the
door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Keep her hout,” said one of the jury. “We
hain’t agoin’ ter hev any women a screech-owlin’ hyar.
It’s one o’ his gals as he’s lef’ to die maybe of a broken
heart ’thout the satisfaction o’ bein’ a widder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me pass, please,” said an imperious little
voice that thrilled Cotterell to the heart. “I am one
of the witnesses in this trial. I have important evidence
to give.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The men fell back and left the passage free. Western
men, even armed ones, can’t do anything against
a woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive came into the crowded room, Olive dirty,
dishevelled, travel-stained, her face begrimed with
prairie dust, her hair unkempt, her dress crumpled
and with many a rent in it. Cotterell hardly knew
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who mought yer be, miss?” inquired one of the
jury.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am Mrs. Weston.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whar’s yer husband? Yer hadn’t oughter be hyar
a follerin’ this feller roun’ the prairie. Tain’t——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shut yer mouth or I’ll send a bullet down yer
gullet,” roared the foreman, putting his hand to his
revolver. “Take a cheer,” he added, gallantly offering
Olive the sugar-barrel upon which he had been sitting
in his official capacity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thank you,” said Olive. “I will stand.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>She took her place beside Cotterell, but without looking
at him or addressing a single word to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you trying this man for?” she asked,
facing the jury dauntlessly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, mos’ly fur stealin’ yer hoss,” said one of
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t steal it. I myself lent him the horse.
It belongs to us,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Gosh!” exclaimed Owen, “you tole me yerself
yer hadn’t sot n’ary an eye on him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I hadn’t when you were there, he did not
come until the next day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The jury whistled collectively and incredulously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Silence!” said the foreman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can now explain,” said Cotterell. “I didn’t go
to Mrs. Weston’s house until two days after—after
Mills’ death——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A’ter yer killed him,” corrected Owen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you were there the next day,” concluded
Cotterell, not taking any notice of the interruption.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, that is it. Mr. Cotterell came the next evening
but one after the prairie fire, and I gave him the
mare to go away on, because his colt broke loose from
the bars in the dark.” Olive spoke quite quietly, with
no trace of excitement beyond a knitting of her pretty
eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, I reckon we hain’t got nuthin’ more to do
then,” said one of the jury-men, getting up from his
nail-keg and strapping up his holster.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“There’s the murder too,” objected one, “not as
I put it fust noways, on’y we might go inter it now,
seein’ there hain’t nuthin’ ter be got outer the hoss-stealin’
business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yer hain’t got evidence for the murder case too,
has yer?” sneered the man who had been so peremptorily
silenced by the foreman on his first objection
to Olive’s presence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only this. You are not non-resistants, are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We hain’t such blasted fools,” observed the Arkansas
man genially.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, when this poor Jake Mills in his
drunken fury came up and fired at Mr. Cotterell, was
he or was he not to fire in self-defence, according to
your ideas and practice?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course he was,” said the jury in unison.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then that is what he did. Jake Mills fired
first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two shots,” said Cotterell in a low voice, but
every man in the room heard him distinctly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That coloured man we saw yesterday swore that
Cotterell lay in wait for Mills, and fired from under
cover as he came up to the house,” said a man from
Illinois who had not spoken hitherto.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal now,” said the Arkansas man, “I didn’t
say nuthin’ ’bout that yesterday. Long as it was hoss-stealin’
we knowed whar we was an’ what we hed
ter do, ’cause we hed the hoss. But this hyar shootin’
business hain’t noways the same. Any gen’leman hyar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>might hev a difference with any other gen’leman, an’
’s long as it were done fair, I don’t see as how anyone
hes any business to say they shouldn’t settle it
with pistols or bowie-knives accordin’ to taste. We
are all for freedom in this country I reckon, an’ that’s
how it hes been done in Arkansas often an’ satisfact’ry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This ain’t Arkansas, an’ we are determined to
put a stop to this shootin’ round every day,” said the
Illinois man firmly. “It ain’t respectable and it stops
quiet settlers from coming here to take farms. We
are going to stop it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you should have stopped Jake Mills when
he went to Mr. Cotterell’s and fired at him first,” said
Olive quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s somethin’ in that,” said the foreman,
whose native gallantry led him to side with a pretty
woman. “In a trial we hev to consider all the p’ints
o’ the case. I consider that as for the horse-stealin’,
that hes mostly broke down under evidence. We must
now go into the other charge, which is shootin’ Jake
Mills, an’ a damned scoundrel he was too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The jury laughed pleasantly at this sally from
the bench, or to speak more accurately from the sugar-barrel.
Even Cotterell seemed a trifle amused, only
Olive did not unknit her eyebrows, nor did the hard
lines around her mouth in the least relax.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are in consider’ble difficulty ’bout this here
shootin’ case,” continued the foreman when the mirth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>had subsided, “and if I had knowed as that was all
we was up for tryin’, I don’t reckon we ’ud all on us
ha’ been here as is now collected together to maintain
the rights an’ freedom o’ our country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The jury murmured applause, upon recognising
well-known Fourth of July phrases, which have perennial
power to stir the American breast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why ain’t we agoin’ on with this blamed trial?”
asked an impatient jury man. “We hev purty nigh
lost a whole day’s work a’ready an’ hain’t finished
nothin’ yit. When we strung up ole Howard for hoss-stealin’
we hed the job done clar up afore noon, an’
we could go home to dinner comfor’ble.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive gave a faint inarticulate cry and put her
hands up to her ears, or was it perchance to her neck?
Cotterell turned anxiously towards her as if she was
going to faint, and he would catch her before she fell.
She steadied herself in an instant and again faced the
jury like a tiny lioness, small in body but with unconquerable
courage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, gen’lemen, I’m agreeable to proceed with
the evidence,” said the foreman graciously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was told we had evidence o’ deliberate murder,”
said the Illinois juror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We most on us hearn what the nigger said,” remarked
another carelessly, “some on us fooled roun’
with that yesterday an’ lost a fair half day’s work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, gen’lemen, you could ha’ had the nigger
again here to-day, on’y it was not considered necessary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>as we was mostly of opinion to fin’ a true bill
on the horse-stealin’ count. We can send for the nigger.
He’s mos’ likely sneakin’ roun’ here. Them niggers
is jes’ like buzzards, they can scent out where
there’s a hangin’,—ahem, gen’lemen, we’ll proceed,”
said the foreman, suddenly recollecting himself and
Olive’s presence barely in time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I vote for sending for the coloured man,” said
the Illinois juror firmly. “We’ll confront him with
the prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigger be damned!” roared the Arkansas man
jumping violently off his nail-keg. “Yo’ reckon I’m
agoin’ ter sit hyar an’ see a white man hanged on
nigger evidence. No, sir. I won’t stan’ such a insult
to my race as that. There be some things a
man o’ honour won’t stan’ an’ that’s one o’ them. Thar
hain’t no man spryer to light out an’ catch a hoss-thief
nor I be, an’ I’ll do my dooty in the hangin’ too,
an’ hol’ the rope as tight as ony o’ yo’all. But I’ll
bust up afore I’ll take nigger evidence ’gin a white
man. I reckon there hain’t none o’ yo’ gen’lemen as
is pertikler sot on that nigger, be yer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive’s heart gave a bound of joy as the Arkansas
juror poured forth his torrent of protest. Alas,
poor Olive and her high-flown love of the black race!
She was bound to confess that her best hope for effecting
the end she was struggling for, lay in the blind
race-prejudice of this ignorant Southerner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess we ought to take all the evidence, white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>or black, that bears on the case,” observed he of Illinois.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that thar nigger comes inter this hyar room
to conten’ with this hyar jury an’ give his evidence,
I’ll shoot him, ’fore he gits over that door-sill, so I
will, by God, an’ no man as knows me ever said I went
back o’ my word in shootin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Arkansas juror faced them with his black
eyes ablaze and his dark visage twitching with suppressed
fury. He was quivering under the sting of
what was to him an intolerable insult, and there
was nothing he would not do to wipe out that insult.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive looked at Cotterell for the first time, and
as their eyes met he was horrified to see the white,
drawn expression on her face. He attributed it to the
very natural womanly fear that she might be involved
in a promiscuous shooting affray in that crowded room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be alarmed, they will not bring the negro
in here,” he said soothingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not afraid for myself,” she answered, simply
and truthfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, gen’lemen,” said the foreman pleasantly.
“I reckon we hev finished for this spell anyhow. I
consider the prisoner hes hed as fair a trial as ony man
could wish, and I hev on’y ter thank yer all for yer
help upon this occasion in maintain’ the laws and freedom
of our beloved country, as belongs to the duty of
free-born citizens.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“Hurrah!” said the jury, with another relapse
into Fourth of Julyism.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ve purty nigh lost two whole days’ work ’long
o’ this hyar foolin’,” observed the Arkansas man angrily.
“Them coons up to ’Fection City is nat’ral born
fools anyhow. Fust they blaze roun’ an’ set us on ter
run down a hoss-thief fur ’em. Soon as we’ve done
cotch him, they sen’ roun’ a woman to say the hoss
was lent. If the blamed critters come to me again,
reckon I’ll stick to my plough-handles. I’ll not light
out for them, you bet.” And he immediately walked
out of the store followed by the entire jury and the
foreman.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Court broke up, Olive and Cotterell were
left alone in the store along with Phillipps, the storekeeper.
The latter handed Cotterell his revolver,
which the jury had considerately left for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose I’m a free man,” said Cotterell, with
more sign of emotion in his manner than he had yet
shown.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks to Mrs. Weston you are free,” said Phillipps.</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned to Olive, who seemed in a daze, and
said, “Shall we go now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” she answered, and they left the store together.</p>

<p class='c010'>The crowd in the road before the door was already
fast dispersing. The exciting climax for which they
had waited was not to come off, so there remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>no further inducement to stay. Some straggled into
the smithy, some went towards the mills, but most of
the men were getting their horses, putting on saddles,
and settling halters and reins. The Arkansas man
had a waggon and was hitching his horses to it, as
Olive, riding on Rebel, and Cotterell on Queen Katharine,
passed by.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be yo’ gwine with him?” asked the Arkansas
man, pointing to Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Olive shortly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wish we’d hanged the damned cuss ’fore she
come in,” said the Arkansas man regretfully to his
companion, who had also been present at the trial.
“She’s gwine ter ’lope with him, an’ ole man Weston
he on’y jes’ married her las’ spring.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Reckon she don’t like ’Fection City idees. Gals
mos’ allers likes a fightin’ man best, an’ this hyar one
is reg’lar downright handsome too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we’d on’y hed a-hanged him she couldn’t hev
run off with the coon,” repeated the Arkansas man
with conviction, shaking his head sorrowfully as he
watched the two disappearing among the trees on the
South Fork.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>OLIVE MISSING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There was dire dismay at Perfection City when
the flight of Olive became known. Napoleon Pompey
informed Madame of it the same evening, but, for
reasons best known to herself, she did not announce
the fact until the next morning, when the brethren
and sisters flocked to her house to talk over this surprising
event in all its bearings. The members accounted
for it in different ways and explained it according
to their preconceived notions. Madame at
once said that she had evidently left her husband
whom she had never really loved at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think we must all have noticed how utterly
unsuited she was to him and how uncongenial. She
was no fit companion for a man of Ezra’s mind,” said
Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, now,” observed Uncle David, “I think such
a purty little gal with sweet little kitten-ways was
a most congenial companion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Uncle, you don’t understand men. Men with
minds and high aspirations want a companion capable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of sharing their ideas and aims, they don’t want a
kitten or a plaything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My ’pinion is most men is satisfied with kittens,
if they’re as soft an’ coaxin’ in their ways as little
Ollie is,” replied Uncle David.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess she couldn’t stand the bondage of marriage,”
said Mary Winkle. “When she first came
she was all for being absorbed in her husband, she
would be Mrs. Weston forsooth, she wanted to sink
her individuality. She has naturally found out her
mistake. I respect her and sympathize with her in
her efforts to shake off the trammels of custom and
make a dash for freedom. I dare say we shall soon
have her coming back again, having resumed her own
name, and perhaps ready to lecture on the absurdity
of women giving up their names on marriage, as if
they ceased to exist. Marriage under these circumstances
becomes a sort of death to a woman. It is extinction.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Tain’t no such thing, Sister Mary,” said Uncle
David. “It is an honourable distinction our forefathers
have used, findin’ the same handy and convenient.
I don’t believe little Ollie has gone a-lecterin’,
she ain’t that sort o’ gal. I guess she’s jes’ tired
an’ lonesome feelin’, an’ thought she’d ride out an’
meet Ezry comin’ home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She hasn’t done that, Uncle, for I’ve seen a man
from over Jacksonville way, and he told me she had
been seen the other side of Big Cotton Wood Creek,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and that she was asking for news of Cotterell,” said
Brother Wright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then she has gone to him,” said Madame with
decision.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She hain’t neither,” contradicted Uncle David,
“you hain’t got no business to tell wicked stories like
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She has been carrying on a secret acquaintance
with him all the summer. I know that, for I surprised
them together at the spring some weeks ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She didn’t do nothin’ that was dishonest an’ secret,”
said Uncle David anxiously. “I ain’t agoin’
ter believe anything ’gin little Ollie. She’s a good
little gal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He wiped his forehead nervously with his large
bony hand, and then took out his red handkerchief
and passed it several times across his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The power of love is strong,” said Madame, looking
at him with compassion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes,” he replied quickly, “jes’ what I say,
an’ she did love her husban’, an’ hain’t done nothin’
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She didn’t love him,” burst out Madame with
excitement. “It often filled me with anger to see
how she took all his love and made no return. Everyone
saw it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess the rest of us didn’t pay so much attention
to them and their affairs. We had our own,” said
Mary Winkle, at which Madame winced.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“You don’t know what her feelin’s was. She loved
Ezry, else she wouldn’t ha’ married him an’ followed
him way out here on this lonesome prairie. I ain’t
never goin’ to believe wrong o’ little Ollie.” Uncle
David’s big chest heaved with a sob that would burst
out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame placed her hand gently upon his. “The
falling of one’s idol has always been a grievous sorrow,
and has bruised many a loving heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She wasn’t fit to live here on the prairie,” said
Aunt Ruby, wiping her spectacles with her big checked
handkerchief. “She was too young an’ purty an’ frolicksome
to be here anyhow. Ezry hed ought ter hev
kep’ her in the East, where she was raised, an’ where
she could go to parties, an’ put on purty clo’s, an’
dance, an’ so forth. It’s nat’ral for them young gals
to dance an’ love fin’ry, jes’ as it’s nat’ral for lambs to
skip an’ play in the sunshine. They is born so, an’
I guess the Lord put the right idees into their min’s
at the beginnin’. I don’ wan’ ter skip, an’ Sister Mary
she don’t wan’ ter neither, we hev got ole an’ stiff
by now; but that chile she did wan’ ter, on’y mos’
likely she didn’t know it. Sweet purty little thing, too,
she was, it done my eyes good ter look at her. She
wasn’t fit for ’Fection City, we hain’t got nothin’ for
young folks as don’t care mos’ly to argy ’bout principles,
they loves ter be gay. Why, it wasn’t further
back nor day ’fore yesterday she come ter my house
’long with that pup o’ hern. My stars, didn’t she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>laugh when it took ter scootin’ roun’ ’mong my hens!
It done me a heap o’ good ter hear her, it was like
a silver bell, an’ she hedn’t nothin’ for to amuse her.
I think it was downright sinful o’ Brother Ezry to
take such a sweet purty little thing ’way from her
proper home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Ruby ended her long speech with the twin-sob
to the one that had escaped from Uncle David.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sister, you’re a downright good woman,” said
he gratefully. The two old people nodded at each
other in complete harmony of affection and affliction.</p>

<p class='c010'>A long day passed over Perfection City, a day
without any positive news or confirmation of previous
rumours. The brethren were full of their various
theories in regard to Olive’s disappearance, which they
found necessary to discuss and re-discuss over and
over again. All work was at a stand-still, for the members
congregated at Madame’s house both early and
late, as they considered she would be the first to get
any news from the outside world. Without a horse
they were practically cut off from all communication
with the outside, and were entirely dependent on the
thoughtfulness of such neighbours as might come to
bring them news. It was in the afternoon of the day
of the abortive trial at Union Mills that the first authentic
tidings reached them. They were talking the
matter over together for the fiftieth time when Brother
Green was seen coming very hurriedly from his forge
along with a stranger, who waited outside the door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>with an amount of diffidence unusual on the prairie.
Brother Green’s grimy face wore a look of alarm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ve got news of them both,” he exclaimed,
bursting into the room regardless of ceremony, he who
was generally the most heedful of the little forms of
politeness. “She has gone after him, and they’ve gone
away, and he stole her and said we lent her to him,”
said Brother Green distractedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brother, I don’t understand,” said Madame.
“Who lent what? And where has she gone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean Sister Olive—oh! I’m so sorry—poor
Brother Ezra!—Sister Olive has gone off with Cotterell,
and it was he who stole Queen Katharine, only
it was proved at the trial that she lent her to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Green was too distressed to be a good witness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who told you?” asked Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whoever did told a lie,” said Uncle David.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s outside. He was at the trial and has come
to tell us about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then bring him in,” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stranger entered, looking somewhat abashed.
He was truly sorry to be the bearer of such bad tidings.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Young man, before you begin this wicked tale,
I charge you think of God and tell the truth.” Uncle
David stood before him like an avenging spirit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir, excuse him,” said Madame in her sweet
voice. “The old man is painfully distracted by grief,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>he does not know what he is saying. You have come
to bring us definite news, have you not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m thund’rin’ sorry, so I am, an’ if we’d ha’
knowed how it would ha’ ended, the boys ’ud ha’
made sure by bangin’ him fust an’ havin’ the trial
a’terwards.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you speaking about Mr. Cotterell? We have
not had any news for days, so perhaps you will explain
it all clearly,” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, wal, when ole man Wright come an’ tole
as how yer hoss was stole, the boys they ’lowed as
you was all such damn—such all-fired pertikler folks
as didn’t do yer own shootin’, they ’lowed they oughter
kinder be neighbourly an’ do it for yer. So we sot
out to run down the cuss. We got word from a teamster
from beyond the Creek, he seed a man on a mare
jes’ like yourn agoin’ toward the border. So we
picked up the trail right away. He warn’t worth a
red cent to hide a trail. He jes’ follered straight
ahead ’long the road, axin’ his way an’ follerin’ plumb
on the d’rections. Any fool could ha’ run down such
a coon as him. He war ridin’ yer brown mare when
they come up, an’ he didn’t show fight, jes’ said he’d
stan’ trial, an’ he ’lowed it ’ud be fair. The boys calkerlated
it wouldn’t be a fair trial ’less they toted him
roun’ to Union Mills, which are his own post-office,
an’ if that ain’t treatin’ a man fair nothin’ is. An’
they got a new set o’ men to stan’ jury as what cotch
him, ’cause mos’ on ’em was that mad for leavin’ the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>corn-shuckin’ to run down such a nat’ral born fool,
they’d ha’ mos’ likely strung him slap up. It war all
done fair, we kep’ him down to Phillipps’ store over
night, an’ I tuk a spell o’ stan’in’ guard. We didn’t
sen’ for none o’ yo’uns, ’cause we knowed yer be all
sot agin hangin’, an’ yer can’t have a man on a jury
who’s sot agin hangin’ when that’s all yer want ter
git done, can yer? So we was a-tryin’ of him fair, with
ole man Strong for foreman ’cause he knowed all the
forms, as he was out to the hangin’ of Howard an’
that thief over to Jacksonville an’ mos’ on ’em. He
was pertikler to do it all straight ’cordin’ to law, an’
we was gittin’ ’long slick, when Mis’ Weston come an’
bust it all up. She said she lent him the hoss, an’ it
war hern.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The narrator stopped to observe the effect of this
announcement. He felt repaid.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe it,” sobbed Uncle David.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hearn her say it,” said the man. His complete
enjoyment of the effect was marred by the tears
of that poor old man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had to let him off, o’ course, for the stealin’,
an’ we couldn’t hang him for the shootin’ o’ Jake
Mills, ’cause some o’ the boys said they’d never hang
on nigger evidence, an’ we hadn’t none other. Anyhow,
that nigger he drowned hisself in lies right away,
an’ we didn’t lay much on what he done tole us, you
bet. But we was powerful sorry a’terwards when we
seen what we’d done. She’s gone off with him plumb.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“No, no, not that,” said Uncle David, “tain’t so,
you didn’t un’erstan’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We axed her war she a-gwine with him, an’ she
said, ‘yes,’ I hearn her say so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was on’y goin’ home,” said Uncle David
tremulously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She had not come home half an hour ago,” observed
Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They rode ’long to the South Fork, an’ that don’t
lie on her road home from Union Mills, do it? I
stayed behin’ at the Store, the boys was talkin’ if they
hadn’t bes’ go right a’ter him an’ shoot him anyhow,
but we ’lowed he’d ha’ showed fight then, an’ maybe
she’d ha’ been killed in the shootin’. Yer can’t never
say who’ll be hit when everybody’s firin’ like blazes.
I didn’t quit the Mills for a spell, an’ mos’ the boys
was ’ready gone home, an’ they allowed I oughter tell
yer we done our best for yer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They thanked him, and he went his way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Somebody has got to tell Brother Ezra, he will
be coming home to-night,” said the blacksmith, wiping
his sleeve across his forehead. “Poor Ezra! What
a home-coming!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Green remained silent for a long time,
then he spoke again in a soft low voice, almost as if
he was communing with himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I laid my young wife in her grave with
her babe on her breast, fifteen years ago last Midsummer,
I thought I had known the greatest sorrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>possible to the human heart. But my loss was not
so great as Brother Ezra’s, his cup is filled to the brim,
and oh, how bitter! How great a power of suffering
lies in the human heart!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is through suffering that the heart is purified,”
said Madame to him in reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, so they say: but some sorts of sorrow may
very well embitter. People talk of the purifying by
sorrow. It seems to me that happiness can purify
too. We are all sure to get our share of the sorrow
in this world, it is the happiness that so seldom comes
to a man. Brother Ezra was happy, is happy, poor
man, since he does not yet know of the wreck of his
home. It was a delight to see him so happy. And she,
poor young thing, my heart aches for her! She was
in my forge the other day, said she was lonesome and
came to talk. Poor child! We are all to blame. Why
did we leave her alone? Why didn’t I think of going
to see her, instead of merely remembering how bright
she was in the forge. We should have looked after
her. Madame, why didn’t you do so? You are the
chief.” Brother Green’s voice had a stern ring in it,
that immensely surprised Madame in her self-contained
calm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I!” she exclaimed hastily. “I had absolutely
no control over her, and no influence. She was one
of the most determined young women I ever
knew, and the least liable to yield to the judgment of
others.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“No, I don’t think that was her character,” said
Brother Green.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are taken by the pretty face, like Brother
Ezra, and are utterly ignorant of the mind within.
Men are always like that in regard to a pretty woman,”
said Madame scornfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Beauty is a great power, no doubt,” admitted
Brother Green, “but people may err just as widely
by judging everything from the prejudiced point of
view as by yielding too far to favourable impressions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brother Green,” said Uncle David earnestly,
“I’m right glad you’re like me, you won’t believe
nothin’ ’gainst little Ollie, will you, no more than
I will?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will hope for the best and that there may be
some reasonable explanation of her disappearance,”
said Brother Green, looking compassionately at the
piteous old face that scanned his so eagerly for some
scrap of comfort.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see what explanation there can be but
the one we have already received,” said Madame
icily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who will break this sorrowful news to Ezra?”
asked Brother Green. “Will you do it, Uncle David?
You would do it tenderly, as you have faith in her
still.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, I couldn’t bear to see the look o’ death
in his eyes, an’ it ’ud come no matter how I told it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>when I came to sayin’ little Ollie was gone an’ we
didn’t know where.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think perhaps I had best take this painful duty
upon myself,” suggested Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, after all, maybe you are the best person.
But remember to deal tenderly with him in his sorrow.
You will know what to say to instil some hope
into his heart,” said Brother Green sadly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ don’t you tell him she’s gone off with that
man Cotterell, for she hain’t done no such thing,”
said Uncle David anxiously. “You jes’ say we don’t
know why she went away, an’ kinder hint as you’re
expectin’ she’ll he home to-morrow or nex’ day. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame told no one what she would say to Ezra,
and made no promises as to how she would say it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>MADAME’S SYMPATHY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When Madame saw the white covers of the returning
waggons creeping across the prairie she set
out to meet Ezra in order to deliver her message to
him. Her manner was as quiet and collected as ever,
her white smooth brow was perfectly unruffled, and
her blue eyes were as gentle in expression as her
friends had ever known them to be. Was her heart
in reality as calm as her outward appearance would
have led the casual observer to conclude? No one
ever knew what was passing in Madame’s mind. Still
she must have known that she was about to stab to
the heart a man upon whose friendship she had seemed
to set great value. Having reached the slope over
Weddell’s Gully, whence she could see that blackened
field where she had saved Ezra on the night of the fire,
she sat down and waited until his waggon came up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, Madame!” said he cheerily, as he pulled up.
“How glad I am to get home again! It has seemed
such a long four days to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And to us also,” answered Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“All well, I hope,” said Ezra reaching down his
hand in order to help her up to the seat beside himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have had misfortunes at Perfection City.
The brown mare has been stolen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Queen Katharine gone, and our most
valuable animal too! That is indeed a loss!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just wait a few minutes,” said she, putting her
hand on his to stop him from giving the signal to
the horses to start on again. “I have some things
to talk about, Ezra. Do you remember that night,
not long ago in reality, though it seems an age, when
I found you lying here on the edge of the fire?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it likely I could ever forget that or who it
was came to my rescue?” said Ezra warmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was thinking as you drove up that perhaps it
would have been a kinder act to have left you to die
in your unconsciousness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter?” said Ezra, greatly startled
by her words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have bad news,” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it Olive?” asked Ezra, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it is Olive.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is she ill?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Worse than that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My God, is my wife dead?” cried Ezra in a
stifled whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Worse than that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There can’t be worse,” said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Yes, there can. She has left you and gone off
with Cotterell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra threw up his arms and fell backwards. Madame
thought for a moment or two that he was dying,
for an awful blue-purple look passed over his face
as if his heart had stopped beating. He recovered
himself and sat up, turned ghastly white, and moved
his lips. He was trying to speak, but no sound came.
At length he gasped,</p>

<p class='c010'>“Olive, Olive, where is she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We don’t know. Cotterell took the brown mare,
the men turned out and caught him. Olive disappeared,
no one knew where, night before last, taking
our last horse. There was a sort of lynch-law trial
at Union Mills, she appeared in the middle of the proceedings
and said she gave him the horse, and then
they went off together and have not since been heard
of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Olive, Olive, Olive!” Ezra kept moaning as
Madame drove him back to his deserted home. He
seemed dazed and stupefied.</p>

<p class='c010'>Surely terrible news was never more crudely broken
to a sufferer than was his bereavement to Ezra Weston,
and by that tender and sympathetic friend, Madame
Morozoff-Smith. Had Uncle David or Brother Green
heard her, they would have been shocked beyond
measure at having entrusted the painful embassy
to such hands. Not one word of hope or
comfort or of doubt even, nothing but the bald
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>hideous story in its worst complexion thrown at
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive was gone from him—gone with Cotterell!</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet after having thus dealt him a death-blow,
Madame seemed full of pity and little acts of personal
attention. She helped him out of the waggon, brought
him into the house, took his hands and washed them,
cooled his forehead with a wet towel, offered him food,
and in short treated him much as if he had been a
suffering child whom she was tending. At last he
seemed to recover himself somewhat as she was passing
her soft hand across his brow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very good to me,” he said brokenly,
“and if I seem to accept your kindness unheedingly,
forgive me. I am not myself to-night. I don’t know
what I am doing. Oh, it can’t be!” he suddenly
burst out. “She is not gone. I shall see her again.
She will come back. How do you know she has gone
with him? I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor Ezra, love dies hard, I know. Some of
the men asked if she was going with him, and she
answered distinctly, ‘Yes.’ Then they were sorry,
they said, they had not hung him before she came
up with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I won’t believe it. Something has happened
to her. Why should she go off with him?” said Ezra
distractedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you not know that he was repeatedly here
to see her, whenever you were out of the way?” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Madame, who did not think she was exaggerating in
any way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She told me all that,” answered Ezra nervously,
“but she was only amused by his talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, your love is blind. Dear Ezra, I wish I
could soften the blow. There is no doubt about it.
I saw them once together at the spring, he kissed her
at parting. It was a man and the woman he loved.
I cannot be mistaken. Remember he was very handsome
and winning in his manners, and she was young
and pretty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, my sweet little Ollie! My little rose-bud,”
cried Ezra, starting to his feet. “I’ll go to her, she
shall not wander away out of my reach without one
effort to save her from herself. She was only a child.
Why didn’t you look after her?” he asked, suddenly
facing Madame with an angry glance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you give her into my charge either by word
or hint?” returned she, somewhat taken aback.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was not your fault. Forgive me. I am too
distracted to know what I say. I remember she refused
to go to you. She said she would rather stay
at home. I tried to urge her, but she would not consent
to it,” said Ezra in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah,” remarked Madame, “very possibly she expected
him to come to her during your absence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, you shall not say that!” said Ezra in
agony. “I cannot bear it. She had no such thought.
She was as innocent as the flowers, as she looked at me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>with her sweet eyes. She had no such thought, I
know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is ever thus,” said Madame, coming closer to
him and speaking with an unwonted tremor in her
voice. “Love seems always at cross purposes. You
give all your love to Olive, who gives all hers to Cotterell.
Another gives all her love to you. We are
equally unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra gazed at her in silent amazement as if he
were doubting that he had understood her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” she went on more calmly in her deep sweet
voice. “I am more in need of pity than you. Your
love has left you, and you grieve, but men will give
you sympathy. When I lost my love I had to smile
and pretend delight. I had to look on his joy and
hers. You are not called upon to congratulate Cotterell
on his happiness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great God, is that you, Madame? Or is it that
I am going mad, and is this some mocking fiend?”
gasped Ezra, starting up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a mocking fiend, Ezra, but I myself who
for once in this world am enjoying the rare privilege
of telling the truth. Ezra Weston, you are not the
most unhappy person in Perfection City. I have long
enjoyed that melancholy pre-eminence. Now in a
common misfortune let us comfort one another.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra sat down again and dropped his head in his
hands. Occasionally he looked at her as she moved
about the room putting everything in order. It almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>seemed as if he was trying to understand who
she was and that he could hardly do so, his mind was
in such a turmoil of grief and misery. She laid out
two more candles beside those already alight in the
candle-sticks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will sit up all night,” she said at last.
“These candles will last half the time, then light the
other two. It is hard sitting in the dark alone with
one’s breaking thoughts. Light the candles and keep
them burning. That is what I did on the night you
left to go to Smyrna to be married, and on the night
when you brought her home here to Perfection City.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She closed the door and left him alone with those
two thoughts. Was it her marvellous reading of the
human heart which prompted this extraordinary
woman to declare her love to Ezra in those bold uncompromising
words on this night of all others in
his life? She knew that he would sit there in his
deserted home, brooding over his lost wife, she knew
also that every now and then the scorching recollection
of what she had said would break in upon the
brooding thoughts and scatter them. This then was
the means, the almost unheard-of means, she had
taken in order to soften the blow that had fallen upon
him. He would not be able to think of himself as the
most unhappy individual in Perfection City, because
she had claimed that distinction in words which he
never could forget. It was just as she had foreseen.
It repeatedly happened during the course of that long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>and dreadful night that Ezra forgot why he was sitting
alone in the kitchen, so lost was he in amazement at
the recollection of the words which Madame had
spoken. As the hours wore on it seemed to him that
they became more and more impossible, until he began
to think of them as the work of a brain unhinged by
sorrow. Was it all a hideous dream, and would he
awake by and bye? The first pair of candles burned
out, and he lighted the second pair, recalling as he
did so what she had said she did when he brought
Olive home. Ah, Olive, Olive! His heart kept calling
out in its misery.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went into their little private room off the
kitchen, in a sort of infatuation to see if she might
be there. No. All was silent, still, deserted. He examined
the tiny room minutely, saw the half-withered
flowers on the table, took them up, and would have
kissed them in his misery, only his eye lighted on a
strange object he had never seen before. It was a
man’s heavy seal-ring. He picked it up and examined
it by the light of the candle: a plain gold ring
set with a well-cut onyx intaglio of a griffin’s head.
As he turned it about the light showed something-engraved
in the inside of the ring. He held the candle
nearer and read “J. G. C.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He dropped the ring as if it had been an adder,
and fled out of the room. As if pursued by furies,
he rushed from the house and wandered about out
of doors. Diana, who since Olive’s departure had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>been in a most miserable frame of mind, followed
him about dejectedly, with her tail between her legs.
Ezra, turning, saw the dog and for one moment felt
a savage desire to kill it, for Olive had loved the dog
and Olive had broken his heart. This phase passed,
and in a passion of grief and despair he stooped and
kissed the animal, for Olive had often patted Diana’s
head, and fondled her long ears. The dog whined
in sympathy and turned suggestively back to the house.
Ezra followed mechanically. He would not go into
the room where that ring lay, but remained in the
kitchen. Exhausted nature could stand no more, and
towards morning he fell into a troubled sleep, with
his head resting upon his arms crossed on the table.
Then in his dreams Olive came back to him in that
vivid yet unsatisfying way in which our dearest do
sometimes return to us, seemingly but to mock our
grief. Olive was there, standing before him, but she
looked at him not with her eyes, but with Madame’s.
There was something terrible in seeing her own expression
gone and in its place the look of another,
and yet it was Olive, and she called on him to follow
her. He hurried after her with the lead-clogged
feet that always walk in dreams, and strained to reach
her. When he did so, he found Madame. Olive and
Madame flitted before his fevered fancy, always shifting
and changing one into another, until he panted
with the horror of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>He awoke with a start as the door opened. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>half-aroused eyes saw a vaguely defined figure in the
door-way, blocking out the light of the morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Olive,” he said, putting out his hand blindly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come to cook your breakfast,” said
Madame’s soft smooth voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t. I can’t eat it,” said Ezra, falling back
into despair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Life must go on, even when all joy is banished
from it,” she said. “We have each one of us to learn
that lesson, friend Ezra.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She began deftly enough to light the fire and make
the necessary preparations for breakfast. Madame
knew how to do the ordinary house-work that falls
to woman’s lot, only she did not choose to do it in
her own home. Therefore she employed Lucinda for
this purpose, until other and stronger motives arose
which prompted her to undertake the work herself.
The habit of every day life is strong, and when Ezra
saw Madame getting breakfast ready, as a matter of
course he arose and got himself ready, by changing
his clothes and generally performing the necessary
preliminaries to the morning meal. He was less wild
and hollow-eyed after this ceremony, but the extraordinary
drawn and aged look on his face seemed only
the more marked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame cooked an omelette with scraps of savoury
dried beef in it, and after the first mouthful Ezra
was obliged to admit that he relished the food. He
could not go on living on his grief, as Madame said.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>She sat with him and took her breakfast also. Napoleon
Pompey, who would have been in the way,
was relegated to the society of his mother, who divided
her emotions between maternal anger at boyish shortcomings
and maternal love for the short-comer, both
of which were expressed with the exalted vehemence
customary to the negro nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall come each day and cook your food for
you. I have often longed to be able to do something
for you, Ezra. Do not forbid my coming. I have
had so little joy in my life,” said Madame, with a
strange humility of manner totally at variance with
her usual character, which was almost domineering,
one might say. Ezra looked at her in a troubled
sort of way. It soothed him to have her there, and
he was glad that somebody, that anybody, could take
an interest in him. Still there came across his mind
flashes of doubt as to what this interest meant. He
could not forget those words that Madame had used
on the evening before. No man who had ever heard
such words from a woman’s lips, if ever man did
hear them under similar circumstances, would ever
again be able to drive them from his memory, but
in his bruised and suffering state Ezra was content
to drift on and let things rest. So Madame came
daily to his house and cooked his food and saw that
he ate something at each meal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Uncle David and the brethren came to see him,
but that gave him no comfort. He shrank from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>sympathy, expressed with kindness, but each word was
like a drop of molten lead upon a raw wound. Willette
was perhaps the only one who gave him real consolation
in this awful time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I say,” remarked the child, in a clear voice and
without a trace of embarrassment, “Sister Ollie’s gone
an’ lost herself down there in the bush, I reckon. She
was ’bout the greenest hand at keepin’ to the Pole
Star ever I see. You could throw her out o’ her direction
quicker nor nothin’. I guess she headed plumb
for the Missouri border when she come ’long with
Cotterell to show him out o’ Union Mills. Guess she’ll
ride ’bout down to Saint Jo ’fore she knows she’s
headin’ wrong. I wouldn’t ’spect her back ’fore a
fortnight.” Willette laughed pleasantly, and poor
Ezra derived some comfort from the preposterous convictions
of the child and her unshakable belief in
Olive.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went to Union Mills to make some inquiries
about his lost wife, and met there the same story
that Madame had already told, but the story was
so brutally hurled at him he could not bear it, and
came home bruised and stricken, his heart bleeding
tears of agony. Instinctively he went to Madame
for comfort.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ezra, perhaps this terrible trial was needed to
purify us all, to make us all more perfect communists.
I can discern a valuable lesson that may be
of profit to the brethren. I begin to think that after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>all marriage is selfish: perfect love alone is unselfish.
You would not have kept Olive beside you by force,
if her heart had gone from you, would you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought our marriage was for life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but she made a mistake as to her feelings;
she found she loved someone else better. It was wise
of her, after all, to break the bond. It would only
have galled you both.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should have been content if she had only let
me love her,” said Ezra.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah yes, I know that feeling but too well,” said
Madame, bringing his mind with a shock to the
thought that she never long allowed to sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a terrible world,” said Ezra beginning to
realize what a spell she was weaving around him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It rests with ourselves to make it easier in the
only way,” replied Madame.</p>

<p class='c010'>Uncle David took up a firm position of his own
and refused to listen to anybody or anything.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hain’t agoin’ to b’lieve nothin’ ’gin little
Ollie,” he announced. “I don’t care ’bout proofs an’
things. Land! If I b’lieved in proofs there hain’t no
sort o’ foolishness I shouldn’t be up to. I b’lieve in
pussons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That was his position, and he stuck to it with unswerving
fidelity. He was happy in his blind faith,
and no one tried to shake it. The old man then began
a strange sort of hunt after Olive. He would sit all
day long at the forge, where, of course, strangers were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>most likely to pass, and to each he would put questions
about the “little gal” he was so pathetically
seeking. He spoke little, he who used to be so chatty,
but sat hour after hour in silent patient expectation
of the return of his loved one. The brethren began
to think he must be losing his wits from sorrow, poor
old man!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE MESSAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A long weary fortnight had passed since the day
when Ezra came home to find his wife gone. Life
went on at Perfection City much the same as before,
although to him it seemed as if the Universe was
out of gear. He took no part or interest in the daily
affairs of the Community, never coming to the Assembly
or consulting with the brethren upon any matters.
He withdrew himself from the companionship
of his fellows, and only that Madame continued to
come to his house every day in order to cook his dinner
and sit with him while he ate it, he would have been
absolutely alone. Ezra acquiesced in her devotion,
and dared not ask himself how the debt was to be repaid
that she was piling up against him. The Pioneers,
who during the past fortnight had revelled in a perfect
carnival of gossip, felt themselves at liberty to
express an opinion upon this new development of the
drama that was being acted in their midst. Sister
Carpenter said to Sister Winkle that she thought there
ought to be a period of mourning allowed, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>brief, between first and second marriage, and that
Brother Ezra hadn’t ought to go a-courting so soon.
She did not know that it was Madame who did the
courting in that strange, forward, imperial way that
we must suppose the Empress Katharine affected.
Uncle David, whom love for Olive had rendered extremely
keen-sighted as to what was going on, evinced
very great displeasure. Madame had no right to try
and make Ezra’s home happy, and he told her so in
language of unmistakable import. She was angry
to a degree that terrified him, and he shrank back
alarmed beyond measure at the wrath which he had
provoked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I know, you want Ezra’s life to be wrecked
by that vain, selfish little hussy who never cared for
him, and who went off with the first gallant that
beckoned to her. Ezra’s life shall not be wrecked,
mine shall be expended in drawing it into a haven
of rest. Olive is not worthy of tying the latchet of
his shoe. I hope she will be cast off by her lover, and
left to sink amid the mud and mire of such as she.
I hate her!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Uncle David was frightened and crept away to
Brother Green, where he sat hour after hour mournfully
watching the fire. It was on one of these days
when he was in the forge that a young negro on a
raw-boned Indian pony rode up to Madame, who was
on the point of starting for her daily expedition to
Ezra’s, and inquired “whar ole man Weston lived,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>as he had a message for him. Instead of answering
directly, Madame endeavoured to find out what the
boy wanted of Ezra. The little darkie thereupon produced
a scrap of crumpled paper from the recesses
of his ragged shirt and informed Madame he wanted
to give him “dat ar’.” Madame took the paper, opened
it, and gave a gasp. Then in a moment she recovered
herself with an effort, and assured the negro it was all
right, and that she would see to it. She made most
particular inquiries as to where he lived, and then
sent him off, happy with a piece of corn-bread and a
dollar for himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having thus got rid of the negro lad, Madame
proceeded on her way to Ezra’s house in order to
perform her daily task there. She seemed strangely
excited, and her blue eyes glittered like sapphires.
Her whole bearing was that of a person labouring
under intense excitement, all traces of which she was
endeavouring to conceal. Her very voice had a new
ring in it as she talked with Ezra, and her breath came
quick and fast. Had his senses been less dulled by
suffering, he could not have failed to notice the change
in her, notwithstanding her efforts at concealment.
He was sitting, looking with unseeing eyes across the
vacant cornfield, when suddenly she spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ezra, let us go away from this place. Let us
leave all the recollections of Perfection City behind
us, and begin life afresh.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned his eyes upon her with a slow questioning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>look, showing how far away had been his
thoughts at the moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can we leave this place? There is too
much money and too much labour sunk in it for us
all to leave and go to some other spot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not all, dear friend, only you and I,” said Madame,
in her caressing voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra started. “That is even more impossible,” he
said, in great agitation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why impossible? I have money. It will more
than suffice for all our needs, nay, it will give us
all the luxuries we can sigh for.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not that, but you forget——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Ezra, I don’t forget, but I want you to forget.
I want you to draw a wet sponge over the recollection
of the past and begin anew. It is not too late.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t know what you are saying, Madame.
You cannot mean it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do mean it, and I know what it means. You
have no tie——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra shivered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Neither have I. We are both free to make our
lives what we list.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You  mistake, we are both tied by all our past
lives, and with bonds that may not be lightly broken.
We are tied by our own feelings as well as by the
good opinion of the world at large.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame snapped her fingers with scorn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That for the world at large and its opinions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Do you remember what I told you about my father
and my birth? Thank God, I have no name to
lose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot do less than tell you the truth,” said
Ezra in great distress. “Wherever I went my heart
would remain here, where I have known true happiness,
and it will always be looking for my lost one to
come back to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She won’t come back till Cotterell is tired of her,”
said Madame brutally. “Will you be grateful for
his cast-off mistress?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop,” said Ezra, putting his hand quickly before
her lips, “you must not speak so of her to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fool that I am!” muttered Madame under her
breath. She turned from him with a gesture of anger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, forgive me,” exclaimed Ezra, seeing and feeling
what the expression meant. “Never was man so
miserable, never was one so unhappily placed. I owe
you more than words can say, I owe you my best
thoughts, I owe you my very life itself. I would willingly
give you my life——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then why not give it and come with me?”
burst out Madame. “Leave all this misery behind
you, I will make your path as smooth as heart could
wish. Come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My heart can never follow any other path, it
will dwell amid the ruins of its former happiness.
Do not speak again of this. Let us remain friends
as before.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“It can never be again as it was before,” said
Madame with heaving bosom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?” asked Ezra. “I have not much else
left in life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not,” repeated Madame in scorn. “You
ask me why not! Would you care for Olive’s friendship
when all her love was given to Cotterell?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop,” cried Ezra, and this time there was a
ring of anger in his voice. “Even you may presume
too far. Do not again speak that name to
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There is something untamed and untameable in
the Russian nature which now and then comes to the
surface and drives an excited Muscovite into acts seemingly
at variance with the highly cultivated standard
to which he aspires. The phenomenon may by the
learned be attributed to a sudden reversion to the
ancestral Asiatic savage. Madame was at this moment
rapidly going back to the state of furious anger, when
all sense of dignity would be lost. She was reverting
to the Asiatic. And under the influence of her passion
her physical appearance changed, her eyes became
narrow slanting openings emitting sparks of
steel-blue flame, her full red lips were drawn tightly
over her teeth. She hissed out her words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does her image still come between us?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does come between us,” said Ezra looking almost
as white as she did. “Her image will always
come between me and every other woman on the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>earth, blotting out every other image and making
me only hers. Oh, Olive! Oh, my wife!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He gave a great sob of agony.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Besotted fool!” burst from Madame’s colourless
lips, “do you hold this language to me? You scorn
me and my love! Then on your own head be the consequences.
Ah, now nothing shall stop me. An angel
from heaven, no, nor God Himself shall stand between
me and my revenge. Ezra Weston, farewell!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She left the room, shutting the door upon him
and his misery. Unhappy man! His world seemed
crumbling beneath his feet. He had lost his wife,
and now his friend, the one whom he most revered,
had cast him out from her regard. What could he
do? His heart answered, nothing but dumbly suffer
in the deserted home where he was left alone. What
a black and barren waste was his life! And how fair
and smiling it had looked a few short weeks ago!
It was as if a devastating fire had passed over him
leaving his heart like the desolated prairie, black and
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame went away alone for one day, no one
knew whither, and came back with a look on her
face that struck terror into all who saw her. Her
smooth white face looked cruel and pitiless, and the
gleam from her eyes reminded one of cold steel. Her
soft hands sometimes closed on their own pink palms
with a spasmodic clutch, as if she had the throat of
an enemy between their cruel grasp and was crushing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the life out of him. A cold dreadful face, a cruel
sickening look that made Napoleon Pompey and Uncle
David shiver within their souls, and caused the brethren
to draw away affrighted from their once beloved
leader. Perfection City was the abode of wretchedness.
The Academy never opened its doors to the
assembled Pioneers, who were afraid to come near
Madame’s house. Each lived by himself, looking
askance at his neighbour, for over all had fallen a
spirit of suspicion. Only Brother Huntley, the deaf
brother, and his mute wife were happy, working on
contentedly, shielded by their misfortune from the
full knowledge of the disasters that had come upon
the Community.</p>

<p class='c010'>The days dragged miserably by, seemingly endowed
with a miraculous length of hours, for the sufferings
of a life-time were compressed into that hideous
fortnight. The glaring sun blazing down upon the
blackened prairie seemed to Ezra to have become no
unfitting symbol of hell. The light was hateful, darkness,
eternal darkness would have been a relief to his
brain. Could it be possible that he was going to
live his life out in a realized purgatory? He was
young, only twenty-five, and if his life was to stretch
even to the average span of human existence, what
an eternity of suffering lay before him! A brokenhearted
man amid the ruins of his broken life.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was on one of these days of utter black despair,
like the days that had gone before and the days that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>were still to come, that the same ragged negro boy on
the straggly Indian pony, who once before had made
his appearance at Perfection City, was seen skulking
around the old land near Weddell’s Gully. He seemed
to want to see without being seen. By and bye Napoleon
Pompey chanced that way and of course
pounced upon him with the universal query of “whar
he gwine?” The boy after some hesitation made it
clear that he had come on a secret mission. He wanted
to find Uncle David without being seen by anyone else,
especially not by the white-faced lady, Madame, of
whom he stood in shivering dread. Napoleon Pompey,
sympathising with the dread, volunteered to take a
letter to Uncle David without fear of detection. Thereupon
the darkie delivered over to him a scrap of newspaper
upon which was written a scrawl with the burnt
end of a stick, and having done so galloped off on
his straggly pony with a whoop of delight, as one
who had escaped dreadful peril. Napoleon Pompey,
finding it difficult to deliver his embassy to Uncle
David undetected, gave the curious missive to Ezra
with intimations that it was to be put into Uncle
David’s hands right away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra took the scrap of paper, saying there must
be some letter inside, and mechanically unfolded it,
when the hoarse scream that he uttered almost made
Napoleon Pompey jump through the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where did you get this?” he panted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Darkie gin it ter me jes’ while back.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Who gave it? What was his name? Where
did he live? Who sent him here?” asked Ezra in a
breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Darkie he didn’t go for to say nuffin, on’y jes’
gin dat ar, an’ tole me ter pike to ole Uncle David
wid it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra darted out of the house and ran like a mad-man
to Madame’s and burst into the room where she
and Uncle David were just sitting down to supper.
He held out the scrap of paper to the old man and
gasped:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Olive is somewhere!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I presume that was already known, and that it can
hardly be considered news,” said Madame’s cool cutting
voice, which brought Ezra somewhat to his senses.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is somewhere near. She sent a negro boy
with this. Read it.” He shoved it under Uncle
David’s nose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t see to read it, read it aloud, let me hear
all she says in her letter,” said the old man with trembling
eagerness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t a letter. It says, ’Uncle come to Olive,’
only those four words, nothing else, and just look,
scratched with a bit of burnt stick on a piece of newspaper!
Oh, think of it! Where can she be? Why
didn’t she write before if she was in trouble? What
has happened?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps it is a hoax,” said Madame between her
drawn white lips.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“There hain’t in this world a bein’ so lost to all
feelin’ as would make a joke o’ our sorrow,” said
Uncle David. “No, Ezra, that’s writ by our little
gal. We must go to her. Come ’long, brother.” He
put on his hat and started cheerfully for the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you going?” asked Madame, in a
muffled voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m agoin’ to little Ollie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is she, do you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ezry, don’t you know where we’ve got to go
to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know nothing, except that this scrap of paper
has been brought by a negro boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra kissed the paper, and Madame’s lips curled
in contempt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it not rather a wild-goose chase to start you
know not whither, and at this time of the evening
too?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can’t wait here after little Ollie’s told us to
come,” said Uncle David simply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cannot you suggest some plan?” asked Ezra,
turning to Madame by force of habit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not I,” she replied contemptuously. “Shall you
go east, west, north, or south? The world lies all before
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ain’t you glad little Ollie’s found?” asked Uncle
David, looking wistfully at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame laughed harshly. They went out of the
room together feeling her presence insupportable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Just round the corner they came upon Napoleon Pompey
who was peeping around to see if he could pick
up any scraps of news. He had divined there was
news from Olive, and with the inquisitiveness of his
race had followed Ezra when he had rushed so wildly
out of the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“D’yer know whar ter go?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said Ezra. “Can you tell us anything of
that negro boy? Do you know where he lives?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ask her,” said Napoleon Pompey, jerking his
thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the door
from which they had just emerged.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ask who?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame,” said Napoleon Pompey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does she know?” asked Ezra, amazed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I seed dat ar pony hyar afore,” replied Napoleon
Pompey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great Heavens!” said Ezra as drops of sweat
burst out on his forehead. He hurried back to the
house with Uncle David. Neither of them spoke a
word.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame,” said Ezra, as they once more stood
in the room, “I have come to ask you a question.
Do you know where my wife is?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She looked him unflinchingly in the face and answered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May the Lord forgive you!” said Uncle David,
in a voice hardly above a whisper, and for some seconds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>there was a complete silence in the room, broken
only by the sound of Ezra’s heavy breathing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is she?” he demanded sternly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go and find her,” was the mocking answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra sprang furiously forward, and almost yelled
out,</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me at once or——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay yes,” she said with a steady look, “you will
drag the secret out, will you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She tore open her dress and exposed her snow-white
throat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“See, there it is handy. Take a knife and cut
my throat. See if I shall flinch. The last gurgle of
my blood bubbling up through the wound, shall bear
a sound of mocking laughter. Strike!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra turned from her in horror. “She must be
mad,” he said to Uncle David.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not mad now, I have been mad all these months,
all these years. Mad to love you, mad in loving such
a one as you. Now I am sane. Ah, how I hate
you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is horrible,” said Ezra, putting his hand before
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Horrible, is it? It is the waking from love’s
young dream. Ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame, dear child, think of all you have been
to us,” said Uncle David, reaching his hands out to
her imploringly. “You have led us, think of all
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“I do think of all that. I think of how I found
this boy,” she said, pointing in scorn to Ezra, “ignorant,
unformed, with wild crude longings. I think
of how I infused light and life into the darkness of
his mind. How I rose, aye, above myself, in order to
lead him up and on. I think of all his half-formed
longings put into working form and endowed with
vital power that he might see his thoughts taking
shape. I made him. He was mine. Then he left me
for a few brief weeks. He saw a pretty doll’s face
with an empty head, and straightway he loves with
never a thought of me. You ask me to think. I do
think of how even this I bore, and so great was my
love that for his sake I welcomed the doll that had
stolen my place, and smiled on her. Even this I did
and remained his friend. She, the doll, attracted by
a handsome face, her love aroused by the stolen kisses
of a yellow moustache, left him. Then I was free to
love him once more. I laid my heart at his feet. He
spurned me. All my love was as nothing against the
memory of the doll who had deserted him. She may
die and rot before word of mine shall restore her to
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Neither Ezra nor Uncle David had attempted to
speak while Madame was pouring forth the torrent
of her bitter words. Ezra felt too overwhelmed to
say anything, for a moment, in the downfall of so
many illusions and high hopes, he forgot even Olive.
Uncle David was the first to recover himself.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“Dear child,” he said, for the first time in his life
addressing her as one beneath him. “These are wild
words you’ve been sayin’. I can’t find it in my heart
to believe they’re true. You are disappointed,
an’ you think wrong can be made right by turnin’
things upside down. Tain’t so. You’ll have to
learn that right an’ wrong can’t change places, nohow
you fix it. You have still your duty here in
the City you’ve founded an’ the principles you’ve set
up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame looked at him with glittering eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you hear the truth about Perfection City
too? Then listen. It is not an experiment in new
principles, it is an example of the oldest the world
has seen—of the folly of a fond woman. I founded
Perfection City so that he might love the founder.
I staked my all on a throw of love’s dice, and lost.
Women have done it before and will do it again.
Some fools degrade their body to win a man, I
degraded my mind. The foundation-stone of Perfection
City was my heart, see what will happen
when it is crushed! Ah, why can we not profit by
the experience of our elders! My mother warned
me, having tried it, never to stake my happiness on
the love of man. I followed her advice for five-and-thirty
happy years. Then I saw <i>him</i>, and the curse
fell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She threw up her arms over her head and backed
towards the door of her own apartment.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“The curse, the curse!” she exclaimed, as she
passed through out of their sight.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra had a confused feeling that he had just seen
someone drowning who had reached appealing hands
towards heaven as she went under.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <span class='large'>OLIVE’S SECOND HOME-COMING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And where was Olive all this time? She and Cotterell
rode out of Union Mills together, as we have
seen, and as was seen by nearly all the men who had assembled
there that morning in the expectation of seeing
him hanged. They rode silently among “the
boys” getting their horses ready, they silently passed
among the trees to the south and crossed the ford of
the Creek. Then Cotterell spoke, pouring forth his
words of thanks and gratitude to her. He was not
ashamed to show that he was deeply moved, now that
none but Olive could see his emotion. She, on the
other hand, seemed almost in an unconscious state so
little heed did she give to his eager words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Speak to me, tell me what you wish,” he pleaded
very gently, noticing her abstraction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want you to go away,” she said slowly. “You
are safe from their anger for this time, but do not
stay here and court danger. This is no place for a
man like you to live. Go while there is yet time.
There is now a blood-feud between you and the Mills.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>They will mark you for vengeance, and they are wild
bad men.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you?” said Cotterell, looking anxiously at
her. “I want to see you safely at home. You are
ill, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am all right,” answered Olive wearily. “You
must go to the South Fork at once. Take the Kansas
City stage this very night and go. There is no time
to be lost.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot, and will not,” answered Cotterell. “I
must take you home first. You look frightfully tired
and ill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it would be the crudest thing you could
do to bring me home. I want to go back to Ezra,
I am so tired,” said Olive plaintively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Must I let you go all by yourself over this lonely
prairie? I cannot bear the thought of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been two days and one night all by myself
out on this lonely prairie in order to save you.
Please do what I ask. Tie Queen Katharine’s rein to
Rebel’s bit, they will then go quietly together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me,” said Cotterell breathlessly, “why have
you been out all this time on the prairie alone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was following the men who had captured you
in order to save you if I could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great Heavens!” he burst out, with his blue
eyes aflame. “And you did this heroic act because
you——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did it because you are an innocent man, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>I wanted you to go back to your country to live a
better life and be a better man than you ever had
been before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The light died out of his eyes. He looked down,
his hands trembled as they had never trembled when
on his trial.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your sacrifice shall not have been in vain,” he
said in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then good-bye, and all good blessings attend
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She shook hands with him and left him standing
at the parting of the ways. When she was quite out
of sight over the ridge on her way towards Cotton
Wood Creek, he, with blinding tears streaming down
his sun-burnt face, turned and walked to the South
Fork, caught the Kansas City stage-coach and departed
out of Olive’s life.</p>

<p class='c010'>She hardly knew what she was doing she felt so
ill. It seemed a relief not to have to talk any more,
for she found it difficult to keep hold of her thoughts,
they seemed constantly to be slipping away from her.
The sun was burning hot, and she had a long way to
go, for she had come out of Union Mills by the south
side instead of the north. Therefore she must make
a great sweep round to the right in order to reach her
home, and she must remember that the Creek was only
to be safely forded at certain places. She rode on
and on, feeling the sun hotter and hotter and her head
heavier and heavier. At last she was so dizzy she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>could no longer see where she was going. Whatever
happened she must lie down for a few minutes. Somehow
she got off her horse and lay down at the side of
the track she had been following, but whether in
sleep or in unconsciousness she never knew.</p>

<p class='c010'>By and by she came to herself again. The horses
were both gone! She had forgotten to picket them.
She did not remember where she was, but mechanically
stumbled along the road and at length was overtaken
by a negro woman driving an ox-waggon. She begged
of the woman to let her get into the waggon and take
her home for she felt ill, and the negress, struck with
pity, declared she would, “fo’ de po’ chile was mos’
sick to deaf anyhow.” Olive got into the waggon
and knew no more for hours—or was it days, or was it
weeks? Two nights out in the poisonous prairie dew
had done their work: she was down with chills and
fever, a raving panting lunatic, or else a stupid heavy
sleeping log, taking no heed of day or night or the
hours as they flew, only craving water to drink, ever
more water to drink. By and by she began to have
intervals when she knew that she was in a strange
place with strange black faces around her. Then at
last her senses returned, and she sent an imploring
message to Ezra to come to her. In reply had come
Madame, stern, fierce-eyed, to see her and crush her
with the awful news that Ezra was dead. Olive fell
back into unconsciousness under the blow, she did not
know for how long. But after weary suffering she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>awoke again, still in that same strange place, still with
those black faces around her, kind and pitying, but
faces she did not know.</p>

<p class='c010'>Trying feebly to gather up again the threads of
her life, she wished to send word to the friends at
Perfection City that she was still alive. The negroes,
who were the only inhabitants of the wretched house
where she was, seemed not to heed her wishes. They
refused to take any messages, but would not say why.
Olive grew stronger, for her young vitality exerted
itself. She demanded to know why they would not
do as she wished, but they fled from her questions
and left her to her suspicions. She tormented them
with questions, and at last they said the white-faced
lady had forbidden them ever to come near her house
again, and they were afraid: she was a very terrible
looking lady when she was angry. Then Olive used
her powers of persuasion upon the negro lad and
eventually got him to take her message in spite of
what his mother said. That was the scrap of paper
that had come into Ezra’s hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pioneers scattered in systematic search for
Olive, spreading out in all directions in a way that
could not fail to be speedily successful. Brother
Green found her on the second day, while Ezra found
the two horses which a thrifty settler had impounded
in his own fields and was unobtrusively working until
they should be called for by their owner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Green was overjoyed at finding Olive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and was not so overwhelmed at hearing of her long
illness as, under different circumstances, he might have
been. In fact he was almost pleased, for that fact,
taken together with the negro woman’s graphic account
of finding her alone and ill on the prairie on
the day “o’ de hoss-thief tryin’,” made it clear to him
that she had never been with Cotterell since she was
at the abortive trial. She was very weak and languid
and took little heed of him or his remarks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ezra will be out of his mind with joy,” he said,
by way of rousing her to some interest, as he was
settling her as comfortably as he could in the ox-waggon,
preparatory to setting out on their return.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ezra is dead,” said Olive wearily.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Green stared hard at her. “What crazy
fancy is this? Ezra is alive and riding over towards
Jacksonville at this moment hunting for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She told me he was dead,” said Olive, beginning
to cry from the revulsion of feeling combined with
physical suffering.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How dared the woman tell such a lie!” exclaimed
Brother Green angrily, and then after a moment
he added more mildly, “Perhaps it was a mere
mistake, she seems to have been kind to you, but
negroes are not a truth-telling race.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was not the negro woman, it was Madame,”
said Olive in a hushed and awe-struck voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, you are raving, Sister Olive,” said
he sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“She came to me and told me during my illness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t tell. I don’t remember when things happened.
I was so ill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then depend upon it, you have fancied this.
Fever fancies seem very real at times.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He experienced a certain relief in speaking thus
confidently on the subject to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The negro woman knows. Ask her who came
here and forbade them to bring any more messages
from me to Perfection City.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was singular, considering the way he had spoken,
that Brother Green did not take this simple means of
assuring himself that Olive’s idea was the effect of
the disordered workings of a fevered brain. But he
said never a word to the negro woman on the subject,
but drove slowly and thoughtfully back to Perfection
City, with Olive in the ox-waggon, lying on a heap of
corn-shucks covered with the ragged patch-quilt the
woman had lent her. It was a long and a weary journey
thus creeping back home over the blackened prairie.
Olive sometimes wondered if she would get there
alive, and she moaned in her misery. For the rest,
Brother Green spoke but little. Since assuring Olive
of the falseness of her idea that Madame had been to
see her, he appeared to have lost the cheerfulness he
had shown upon finding her. Brother Green was
thinking of the future of Perfection City, and it looked
black enough to him. It was no secret that Madame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>had refused to reveal Olive’s whereabouts to her husband,
and in the light of that circumstance he could
foresee nothing but strife, ill-will and enmity in Perfection
City. How were Olive and Madame to meet,
and above all how were they to live in harmony for
the future? These were the thoughts that occupied
his mind and kept him silent during that long slow
drive.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive, too, was trying to look into the future, and
she shivered with dread as she did so. Madame’s pitiless
eyes were before her still, but Ezra would be
there, he would shield her and comfort her, and she
could rest her head peacefully on his honest breast.
Dear Ezra! Why had he not come to her when she
had sent for him? She hoped he would be there to
greet her and to save her from that terrible woman,
whose colourless face in its icy cruelty still haunted
her, filling her with a great dread. She need not
have been so afraid, for when she reached Perfection
City Madame was gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pioneers had indeed a life of much inward
excitement during these days. The return of Olive
and the departure of Madame were events almost
equally calculated to disturb their equanimity as a
Community.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra being still away looking for his wife in the
wrong direction, there was no one to receive her when
she got home. Therefore Brother Green took her to
Sister Mary Winkle’s at once on their arrival. Olive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>was weak, ill, and peevish, she cried with disappointment
at not seeing Ezra. Sister Mary Winkle administered
a stimulant in the way of advice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t take on so like a baby, Olive Weston,
if I were you. Ezra’ll come home probably to-day
or to-morrow, and one day more or less ain’t much
in a life-time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive dried her eyes with energy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Everybody said you had gone off with that man
Cotterell, and so we all thought too,” observed Sister
Winkle conversationally.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How dare you suggest such a thing to me?”
exclaimed Olive, with an amount of angry energy surprising
in one so weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, we had it from the people who saw you
go away with him, and who heard you say you were
going. I don’t see how we could possibly have thought
other than we did.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must be a wicked woman to think such
a thing,” said Olive. Her chin began to quiver piteously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not going to condemn you,” replied Sister
Winkle, in a philosophic vein. “If you found you
preferred him to Ezra I don’t think you would have
been wrong in showing your preference in an unmistakable
manner. Marriage is a partnership which
either side should be free to dissolve. Mistakes are
sometimes made in it as in other affairs. Our marriage
is not a mistake, because Wright and I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>make mistakes, but other people are different, and I
don’t see why they should be punished for an honest
mistake. Marriage should be free. Perfection City
was founded on freedom. We thought that you had
used your right of choice, and since you liked Cotterell
best had gone with him. We thought that Madame
would soon marry Ezra, since he was now free,
and she had always wanted to.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Olive sprang from her chair and steadied herself
with her trembling hands by clutching the back of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mary Winkle, I hate you,” she said, in a voice
choking with emotion. “Perfection City is a sinful,
wicked place. I wish I had never seen it. If I live,
and Ezra loves me, I hope he will take me away so I
may never hear its name again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She stamped bravely out of the house under the
influence of her anger, but her strength did not carry
her far, and she sank down upon the wood-pile weeping
bitterly, unable to walk another step. Sister Mary,
somewhat disgusted at the way in which her philosophy
had been received, resolved to let her cool off a
little before going out to offer Olive an arm to conduct
her back into the house. Thus it came about
that Olive was still sitting weeping on the wood-pile
when Uncle David came hurrying up, having just
heard of her arrival, and close behind him came Ezra
running like a mad-man. When Olive saw him she
started towards her husband with outstretched arms,
but her weakness overcame her, and she would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>fallen to the ground only that he was just in time to
catch her in his arms, where she fell laughing and crying
in the most incoherent manner imaginable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Ezra, you didn’t believe that wicked story?
And you do love me, don’t you? And you won’t
marry her, and you aren’t dead, are you? Tell Mary
Winkle you hate her too. And why didn’t you come
to me when I sent for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ezra could only kiss her, and pet her, and soothe
her in every way while Olive kept saying hysterically,
“You won’t, will you?” and “You will, won’t you?”
All of which Ezra promised faithfully to perform.
She absolutely refused to re-enter Sister Mary Winkle’s
house, whereupon the latter, somewhat conscience-stricken,
offered to send in food for their supper
at their own house, provided Olive was not told
who had sent it. The secret was kept, and Olive partook
heartily of what otherwise would undoubtedly
have choked her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Uncle David hovered over her with anxious love
and remorse. “Bless her heart, o’ course he didn’t
b’lieve nothin’ ’bout her goin’ off. Yer bet he didn’t,
he knowed it was all right, on’y she was so long a-com-in’
home he sorter kinder got oneasy, an’ that’s why
they went out to fin’ her, an’ dear, dear, had she been
an’ gone an’ got that plaguey ague, an’ he not there
to see a’ter her, an’ there wasn’t nothin’ like Ayre’s
Ague Cure for that, an’ he would go right ’long home
this minute an’ get her some right away.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Ezra wanted to hear her story, and she told him
everything from the beginning to the end. When
she came to the end and told him of Madame’s visit,
he shivered and said it must have been delirium, he
bade her think no more of it and never speak of it
again. His mind started back from the thoughts such
a story raised up before him. He was afraid, and
looked away from the abyss, terrified at what lay but
half hidden there.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Madame left Perfection City alone and unattended.
No one knew that she was going, and no one
knew whither she went. Her spirit, however, still hovered
over the city of her founding and made itself
most potently felt. She sold all her rights in the
place, and since these included the land, horses, and
implements, as well as most of the houses, the Pioneers
awoke in early winter to find themselves homeless
and houseless, cast upon the bleak world again. In a
tempest of indignation, Sister Mary Winkle and her
husband departed out of the place, and after them
the Carpenters. The going of the Wrights was highly
characteristic. They had managed to save a waggon
and a pair of horses out of the general wreck, along
with a few of the most primitive household necessaries.
These, with his wife and daughter, Brother Wright
packed into his waggon and started for Union Mills.
At the store there he bought a rifle, a bowie-knife, and
a plentiful supply of ammunition. He came out of
the store looking like a buccaneer ready equipped for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Central America. Mary Winkle raised her hands in
speechless horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I say, pa, be yer goin’ to be a jay-hawker?”
asked Willette, grinning with delight.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wright got into the waggon in grim silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What <i>are</i> you going to be?” asked Sister Mary
recovering her speech at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m going to be a man, Mrs. Wright, and not a
blamed fool any longer. Guess I’ll pre-empt some
land near the Cherokee Reservation, and stick to it
and get the fruits of my toil, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your principles——” stammered his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Damn principles, Mrs. Wright. I’ve had about
enough of them. Common sense is what I want, and
so do you. I guess a spell of that will come handy
now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus they journeyed out of sight, but a legend
came floating back from near the Cherokee lands that
at a difficult ford Wright was attacked by a couple of
robbers, whereupon he took up that new rifle of his
and fired so uncommonly straight that one man fell
into the river, and the other ran away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Green remained at his forge, for blacksmiths
were much in request on the prairie, and such
a one as he was hard to find. The new owner of Perfection
City offered him good inducements to stay,
so he stayed. He is still there shoeing horses and
mending ploughs. The name has been changed to
Mountainburg, in order to emphasise the existence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>the rising ground over Weddell’s Gully. Brother
Green is almost the oldest inhabitant now, and sometimes
he thinks of that far-off English village where
he was born, and it looks brighter and more beautiful
to him as the years roll him away from it. He thinks
too of the grass-grown grave in the church-yard
where the jackdaws caw overhead, and it seems to
him that when his last day’s work shall be done he
would rest more peacefully beside that mound than
in any other spot beneath the broad canopy of
heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brother Dummy decided not to leave when the
rest of the Pioneers scattered. He preferred to stay
where he was and rent a bit of land from the new
owner. By and by he was enabled to buy his bit outright.
For there came a letter addressed to “The
Pioneers of Perfection City” and containing a draft
for five hundred dollars “for the hire of one horse”
from an ever grateful friend. And Brother Dummy
was given this money by the united wish of Olive,
Ezra, Brother Green, and Uncle David, the last
of the Pioneers, because, as they said, he was the
only one who didn’t know why it had been sent,
and he was the only one who had not suffered
through that episode that had so nearly wrecked their
lives.</p>

<p class='c010'>On a cold winter’s day, when the snow lay in
patches on the black prairie, Olive and her husband
and Uncle David set out from Perfection City. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>was pale and thin, and looked very ill as she stood
leaning against the door-way of her dismantled home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I could feel sorry at leaving the prairie,
but I can’t. I never want to see Perfection City again,
but I’m sorry for my little home, and I would like to
see my garden blossom again.” So spoke Olive to
Uncle David, standing beside her with shawls on his
arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wal, now,” replied he sadly, “we came here full
o’ the notion o’ teachin’ folks things, but it ’pears
like as if it wasn’t so much other folks out here as
needed teachin’ as jes’ our own selves. We hev hed
a hard lesson to learn, Ollie, my little gal, but I reckon
we’ve pretty well learned it by now. It mos’ likely
comes to the same thing, on’y it’s a sight more comfortin’
to human pride to set up as a teacher than to
sit down as a learner. We was as certain as anything
we had a bran’ new truth to teach to the world, an’
we was goin’ to show ’em how they’d been doin’ wrong
in everything ’fore we come to set ’em right. We was
jes’ bustin’ with pride and vanity, that’s what we was.
We had foun’ a new road to Kingdom Come, we had.
’Twasn’t no road at all, on’y a coon track leadin’ into
a swamp. Guess we’ll foller the road other folks has
trod before, an’ if we can fill up a slough or help anyone
over the rough bits as is scattered plentiful all
the way, that’ll do for us. Ain’t that your ’pinion,
Ezry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Uncle, we made a mistake. We thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>the great thing to do was to reform the ways of the
world. We forgot that the human heart needed reforming
first of all,” said Ezra, looking sadly at his
poor wan-cheeked little wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And if the heart is right it doesn’t matter about
the rest, does it, dear?” said Olive, looking timidly
at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was sad and down-hearted and the eager enthusiasm
was gone out of his manner. Ezra was much
older-looking than he should have been, if life be
reckoned by solar time alone. He had been aged
by a lapse of mental time and suffering of which
the almanac can take no heed. His wife saw and
understood how he was, at this moment, realizing
the downfall of his young hopes and beliefs, that
was why he gazed so sadly across the desolate
fields.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We take nothing away with us except sad experience,”
he said as he lifted her into the waggon
and drove off.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And our love, dear, which nothing can ever destroy,”
she whispered, pressing his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stooped and kissed her. There were tears in
his eyes. But they made a mistake. They took something
else with them. Something that came tearing
over the prairie with tongue out and tail stiff-stretched
and nose to the ground—Diana, who had been turned
over to Napoleon Pompey to have and to hold, but he
could not hold her when she saw the waggon going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>off, therefore he could not have her. She caught
them up when they were two miles off, and Olive let
the dog clamber all over her, regardless of wet paws,
and lick her face, so delighted were they to meet
again.</p>
